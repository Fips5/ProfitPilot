Investors are revisiting an old playbook as mega-cap tech stocks came back in favor last week. The appetite for growth returned during Thursday\u2019s trading action,despite another hot inflation reportthat puts rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year in doubt. That was a bit of a surprise, given that growth stocks are typically more sensitive to higher interest rates. But experts say the reason why is clear: Strong fundamentals and large cash piles. \u201cMany of these mega cap growth stocks are flush with cash and have lower debt levels, and therefore tend to be less dependent on financing needs and less interest rate sensitive,\u201d Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. Free cash flow from Magnificent 7 members \u2014 Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 jumped more than $100 billion in 2023. Last week, the group outperformed the broader market, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) ending the week with gains, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 1.6% decline. Amazon hit an all-time high, and Alphabet\u2019s valuation briefly crossed $2 trillion. Even Apple finally caught a bid with investors, recording its best day in nearly a year. And Wall Street pros tell Yahoo Finance that the group will likely continue to outperform in a higher-for-longer rate environment, at least on a relative basis. NewEdge Wealth\u2019s Cameron Dawson said big tech\u2019s solid balance sheets and fundamentals suggest the group is a \u201cdefensive\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d play, adding that pullbacks are \u201clikely buyable in the short-term.\u201d \u201cTech would be somewhat less sensitive to fewer Fed rate cuts compared to other sectors, and would likely outperform in such an environment,\u201d said Lerner. In addition to large cash piles, a resilient economy will be a boon to the Mag 7, Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance. So far, there are few signs that higher rates are slowing GDP growth or corporate earnings. Detrick expects continued economic growth to \u201coffer opportunities for the group, even in the face of less rate cuts.\u201d A more resilient economy can stimulate business activity, and ultimately boost profits this earnings season, another expected driver of big tech in the near term. Analysts estimate the sector\u2019s first-quarter profits to surge 20%, according to Bloomberg data. Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives sees first-quarter results as a \u201cmajor positive catalyst.\u201d \u201cWe expect tech stocks to be up another 15% for the year adding to the strong start to 2024 as now the broader tech growth story takes center stage,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients last week. To sum it up: Delayed rate cuts don't mean a downturn for tech's biggest names. Rather, those with strong fundamentals can outperform \u2014 despite valuation and rate concerns \u2014 and potentially provide stability for the broader market landscape.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/new-masters-apple-vision-pro-app-gives-golf-fans-whole-new-way-to-experience-the-tournament-160506281.html": "The Masters Tournament is adding virtual reality and generative AI to the golf fan experience in the latest attempt to grow the game. For the 2024 tournament, IBM (IBM) and Masters introduced an app for the Apple (AAPL) Vision Pro for fans of the sport who can\u2019t make the trip to Augusta National Golf Course in Georgia. \u201cThis year\u2019s new Hole Insights feature, for example, uses eight years of historical Tournament data \u2014 more than 170,000 shots \u2014 to provide fans detailed breakdowns of how the course at Augusta has played,\u201d Noah Syken, IBM's vice president of Sports and Entertainment, wrote in a statement to Yahoo Finance. \u201cThat level of detail allows a life-long golf fan following along at home to feel more connected to the action, while also making the game more approachable for a new fan at the same time.\u201d A Masters invitation is one of golf\u2019s most coveted for players, and it's hosted at Augusta National, one of the most exclusive country clubs in the world. Entry isn\u2019t guaranteed for fans, either, and tickets are limited to Masters lottery winners. As of midway through the second round on Friday, the most affordable ticket for the final round at the Masters championship on Sunday cost $1,785. Instead of breaking the bank, many fans view the tournament on television, streaming platforms, or on the Masters web and mobile applications. Now, the Masters app, combined with IBM watsonx data and theApple Vision Pro device, expands an experiential portal for fans who want to enjoy the event affordably from afar. \u201cThis partnership is a great example of how data and AI can lead to once-unimaginable digital experiences that help fans feel closer to the events they care about,\u201d Syken said. Those who are able to attend the event in person, however, are spending in droves on everything from restaurants and lodging to souvenirs. Fans have been pouring into the gift shop at Augusta National and waiting in amusement park-like lines just to enter the store to purchase Masters golf merchandise, which can only be bought in person. According to a top Master Card economist, it shows the strong rebound of the experience economy and \u201cthe purchasing power that's still out there on aggregate.\u201d \u201cSmall businesses [are] seeing a really important lift,\" Mastercard Economics Institute chief US economist Michelle Meyertold Yahoo Financeabout the impact of the Masters on Augusta's local economy. \"International folks [are] coming in. Tourism [is] bringing about this big burst of activity. So it shows you that consumers are really looking for those moments in time to spend, and when they find it, they have the ability to really participate.\u201d Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nvidias-stock-sell-off-matters-and-what-people-are-saying-about-it-123044984.html": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Something weird happened in the stock market this week \u2014 besides the thumping from asurpriseConsumer Price Index (CPI) report. Market darling Nvidia's (NVDA) stock fell into correction territory, defined as a 10% decline from a recent high. At its low of around $830 midway through Tuesday's session, the stock was down 12.6% from its March 25 high. It has since recovered a bit to $900 but is still off by 5% from the highs. \"This is a breather for Nvidia, as more investors are playing the 2nd and 3rd derivatives of AI across the semi and software ecosystem,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me. \"We view this as a digestion period for the Street for Nvidia and nothing more.\" Maybe that will prove correct. Who knows? Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya notes volatility in Nvidia is nothing new \u2014 the current sell-off marks the ninth time the stock has declined 10% or more since ChatGPT was launched back in late 2022. \"There are some market factors such as the recent rise in inflation, volatility (VIX), AI stock fatigue, rotation towards more cyclical sectors and possibly some pruning ahead of upcoming earnings season,\" Arya said. \"On a fundamental basis we have also heard of investor concern around rising competition and reducing lead-times (suggesting decelerating demand) for Nvidia GPU accelerators (though expected as new Blackwell demand grows).\" I happen to think Nvidia's stock sell-off is a near-term headwind to the broader markets that should be respected way more than it is. Arya gets at it a bit in his note, but it warrants further amplification. Here is a stock truly beloved by Wall Street and Main Street \u2014 for real, fundamental reasons such as the AI explosion powering demand for super chips \u2014 losing ground. It's one of the clearest signs yet that investors think stocks have come on too hard and too fast this year against a backdrop of higher for longer interest rates. Moreover, the price action suggests investors who are actively seeking new reasons to buy stocks at peak valuations are coming up empty. Now, they may simply be waiting to buy top names like Nvidia at cheaper prices. That wait-and-see mindset is what the pros are doing with Nvidia's stock and other stocks with a high valuation but well-understood investment thesis. And it's not like we haven't seen Nvidia leading the broader market lower before \u2014 it happened last summer! Evercore ISI strategist Julian Emanuel correctly pointed out that Nvidia's stock did next to nothing from July 2023 to October 2023 (chart below). It ended up being the catalyst that brought the S&P 500 lower. Bottom line: For the broader market to get its mojo back, its favorite stock has to get its mojo back.
