        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-things-i-want-to-hear-from-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-at-the-milken-conference-123017130.html": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Sound the alarm bell \u2014 we are about to have a post-earnings Elon Musk sighting. The annual Milken conference, held at the Beverly Hills Hilton, is financial media's version of the Oscars. It's posh, expensive (no swag bags given to us commoners \u2014 we couldn't accept them anyway!), and crazy crowded. You never know who you will run into at the patio coffee bar. And you end up leaving more knowledgeable on something than when you came in. This year's conference promises to be true to form. Former President Bill Clinton is on the speaking docket and will likely have a few choice words on the upcoming presidential election. Sports greats Magic Johnson and Alex Rodriguez are on panel chats, ditto investing titan Ken Griffin of Citadel. The Yahoo Finance squad of yours truly,Akiko Fujita, and Yasmin Khorram will be there, reporting live bright and early from inside the hotel. Our coverage kicks off at 9:00 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance, with a host of market-moving, big-name interviews. Out of all the action we'll be a part of, we are probably most intrigued by Musk's entrance to the star-studded program. The Tesla (TSLA) CEO will bespeaking at 5 p.m. PTon Monday with the famed (and conference host) Michael Milken. Musk is a busy guy, to say the least, and isn't exactly a regular on the annual conference scene. He notoriously hates the World Economic Forum event in Davos, for example. So I suspect he is coming armed with a couple of things to get off his chest, as he should. While Tesla's stock has rallied 22% since its late April earnings report on hopes related to a potential cheap EV, the news flow beyond those numbers has been terrible. The company is in full layoff mode (despite wanting to grow with a new EV, AI, and robots...), sacking its human resources chief and its entire Supercharger department \u2014 despite the impact on partners such as General Motors (GM). The much-delayed Cybertruck has hada major recall. Tesla seems more in chaos mode than ludicrous mode \u2014 and the Street generally would agree. \"We believe our concerns around earnings trajectory remain founded, based on Tesla\u2019s new pragmatic approach to new models raising difficult questions and creating considerable execution risk while leaving limited volume upside,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner said in a client note. Here's a list of items Musk needs to discuss \u2014 and be clear on \u2014 to justify the stock's rally, in this attendee's opinion. Whether he does this, who knows? The room is filled with big thinkers, and he may wax poetic on life on Mars or mean-looking robots that could delicately pet a puppy's butt. How feasible is a profitable robotaxi launch in the next 12 months, and have you discussed this with regulators? Why are you laying people off in droves yet promising major growth with robotaxis, cheaper cars, and robots? Don't you need humans to do this? If you see yourself as an AI company, why bother making low-margin cars? Why not scrap car-making operations and license your powerful technology to other automakers to unlock software-like profit margins? How long do you plan to stay at Tesla given your other obligations? Tesla recalls have been the norm \u2014 how will you ensure product quality on a $25,000 Tesla is up to par with other cars in the price class? Brian Sozziis Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

In addition, the impact of our cost actions over the last year allowed us to meaningfully improve our profitability while still investing in our business to take advantage of growth opportunities ahead,\" said Christian Ulbrich, JLL CEO. Founded in 1999 through the merger of Jones Lang Wootton and LaSalle Partners, JLL (NYSE:JLL) is a company specializing in real estate advisory and investment management services. Technology has been a double-edged sword in real estate services. On the one hand, internet listings are effective at disseminating information far and wide, casting a wide net for buyers and sellers to increase the chances of transactions. On the other hand, digitization in the real estate market could potentially disintermediate key players like agents who use information asymmetries to their advantage. A company\u2019s long-term performance can give signals about its business quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one may grow for years. JLL's annualized revenue growth rate of 5% over the last five years was weak for a consumer discretionary business. Within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends. That's why we also follow short-term performance. JLL's recent history shows the business has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 2.5% over the last two years is below its five-year trend. We can better understand the company's revenue dynamics by analyzing its three most important segments: Work Dynamics, Markets Advisory, and Capital Markets, which are 71%, 18.5%, and 7.4% of revenue. Over the last two years, JLL's Work Dynamics revenue (operational workflows) averaged 9% year-on-year growth while its Markets Advisory (real estate insights) and Capital Markets (financial transactions) revenues averaged declines of 1.9% and 16.8%. This quarter, JLL reported solid year-on-year revenue growth of 8.7%, and its $5.12 billion of revenue outperformed Wall Street's estimates by 6.4%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 5.9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identifieda relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link. If you've followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. Over the last two years, JLL has shown mediocre cash profitability, putting it in a pinch as it gives the company limited opportunities to reinvest, pay down debt, or return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin has averaged 1%, subpar for a consumer discretionary business. JLL burned through $720.7 million of cash in Q1, equivalent to a negative 14.1% margin, increasing its cash burn by 5.9% year on year. We were impressed by how significantly JLL blew past analysts' EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its operating margin outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a solid quarter. The stock is up 2.8% after reporting and currently trades at $190.5 per share. JLL may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.
