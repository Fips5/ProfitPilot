The stock has skyrocketed, showing a 70% increase year to date and a staggering 1,749% return over the past five years. The surge in Nvidia\u2019s share price has significantly increased the wealth of its founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. According to Forbes, Huang now ranks as the 20th richest person in the world, with a net worth of $72.2 billion. Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in.

During a recent \u201cView From The Top\u201d interview at Stanford Graduate School of Business, Huang was asked why he created a flat organizational structure for his company. In his response, he reflected on his humble beginnings. \u201cTo me, no task is beneath me because remember, I used to be a dishwasher, and I mean that, and I used to clean toilets. I mean, I cleaned a lot of toilets, I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined, and some of them, you just can't unsee,\u201d hesaid. Huang\u2019s light-hearted remark elicited laughter from the audience. He continued, \u201cI don't know what to tell you, that's life, and so you can't show me a task that's beneath me.\u201d Huang emphasizes his willingness to help others by sharing his approach to problem-solving. He states that his assistance is not about whether a task is beneath him but about being of service: by demonstrating his reasoning process on various challenges \u2014 whether they're ambiguous, incalculable, or seemingly daunting \u2014 he empowers others. Huang doesn\u2019t hesitate to make bold statements. During another Stanford event, he made some intriguing remarks about expectations, pain and suffering. Speaking at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research last month, Huang was asked what advice he\u2019d give to students to enhance their chances of success. Rather than prescribing specific actions, hesharedthis insight: \"One of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations.\" Huang went on to note that low expectations aren\u2019t typical among Stanford graduates \u2014 even though he himself is an alumnus. \u201cMost Stanford graduates have very high expectations, and you deserve to have high expectations because you came from a great school. You were very successful. You were top of your class. Obviously, you were able to pay for tuition. And then you\u2019re graduating from one of the finest institutions on the planet. You\u2019re surrounded by other kids that are just incredible,\u201d he elaborated. However, Huang highlighted a significant drawback to this mindset, stating, \u201cPeople with very high expectations have very low resilience. And unfortunately, resilience matters in success.\u201d Read more:'Baby boomers bust': Robert Kiyosaki warns that older Americans will get crushed in the 'biggest bubble in history' \u20143 shockproof assets for instant insurance now Huang believes that the ability to endure setbacks and suffering is crucial for success. However, he\u2019s unsure how to effectively teach this resilience to students \u2014 it may be something they need to experience firsthand. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to teach it to you except that I hope suffering happens to you,\u201d he said. He shared that, although he grew up in an environment that fostered success, he also faced many challenges. Within his company, he uses the term \"pain and suffering\" withglee, seeing such challenges as opportunities to strengthen and refine the character of the organization. For Huang, true greatness in individuals comes from character, not intelligence, and character is shaped by experiences of adversity. \u201cAnd so if I could wish upon you \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to do it \u2014 but for all of you Stanford students, I\u2019d wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering,\u201d he said.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-aviation-industry-is-looking-for-its-own-tesla-140021970.html": "While automakers \u2014 led by Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 have turned out entire fleets of EVs in recent years, aircraft manufacturers are further away from electrifying the industry in the US. That makes an industry goal to reachnet zero emissions by 2050all the more elusive, energy experts say. \"Aviation is really hard to decarbonize,\" Samantha Gross, director of energy security and climate initiative at the Brookings Institution, told Yahoo Finance. \"You're never going to see a battery-powered 737 [plane] because batteries are heavy.\" That\u2019s why the industry is working on a number of green energy solutions like sustainable fuels for larger, long-distance aircraft. Meanwhile, electrifying small planes and helicopters is also on the horizon. To date, a handful of North American startups have made strides towardthe electrification of air travel. And their initiatives are attracting investments frommanufacturing, airlines, and auto giants. United Airlines (UAL) has a $1 billion agreement with Archer Aviation (ACHR) signed several years ago to purchase up to 200 of the startup\u2019s vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, or eVTOLs. Prior to the United deal, the California-based company partnered with European carmaker Stellantis (STLA). On an earnings call earlier this year, Archer co-founder Adam Goldstein explained why the company took an investment from the automaker: \"When I founded Archer, I knew from watching the EV industry that developing the capability to manufacture our aircraft at high volumes was perhaps the No. 1 enabler of our future success alongside the design and certification of the aircraft,\" he said. Meanwhile, Toyota (TM) and Delta (DAL) Airlines have backed Santa Cruz, Calif.-based Joby Aviation (JOBY). The startup\u2019s eVTOLs can travel up to 100 miles on a single charge, or two round trips between JFK Airport and downtown New York City. The company has alreadydeliveredone of its aircraft to the US Air Force for testing and training as part of a broader contract with the US Department of Defense. French plane maker Airbus (AIR.PA) has an internal unit working on its own prototype of an electric air taxi, with a timeline for deliveryby the end of this decade. Last year, American plane manufacturer Boeing (BA) became the sole owner of Wisk Aero, a Mountain View, Calif.-based startup working on eVTOLs. Boeing invested $450 million in the companyin 2022. \u201cWhat they [startups] are doing today \u2014 they\u2019re gathering data on how you operate one of these aircraft in an all-electric environment,\u201d said Dave Shilliday, vice president and general manager of advanced air mobility at Honeywell (HON). The company makes engines and other internal components for traditional and electric aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration has yet to fully certify the commercial use of electric planes in the United States, but Archer and Joby hope to commercially launch them in 2025. Its worth noting, earlier this month China's aviation regulators granted mass production certification for eVTOLs manufactured by Chinese startup EHang (EH). Wisk has been working on a fully autonomous air taxisince 2010.The startup's \u201cGeneration 6\u201d has a 90-mile range and can carry four passengers and their carry-on luggage. There are no pilots on board, but flights are overseen by humans on the ground. Wisk recently announced a deal with the City of Sugar Land, Texas, to develop an infrastructure that would eventually allow for Wisk\u2019s autonomous air taxi operations in the Greater Houston region. The company says its goal is to make the service affordable for all, from college students to professionals. \u201cA trip in Wisk\u2019s aircraft will be comparable to a basic ride-share service cost per mile,\u201d a spokesperson said. It\u2019s unclear when Generation 6 will receive certification to fly commercially, but the company has already performed roughly 1,700 test flights across multiple generations of the aircraft. Just as hybrid cars have become the interim step to going all electric for the auto industry, the aircraft industry is going electric in steps. One example is Ontario, Canada-based Horizon Aircraft (HOVR), which is currently working on a 15-foot-long hybrid eVTOL, initially targeted toward municipality use and emergency situations like hospital transports. \"Think of it [the hybrid] as a very practical bridge to a future when all-electric aircraft actually make a lot more sense,\" said Brandon Robinson, co-founder and CEO of Horizon Aircraft. The former Canadian fighter pilot envisions that cost-effectiveness will drive more hybrid solutions in the near term. \"When you burn less fuel per unit mile, you not only save yourself costs, but also, from a sustainable aviation perspective, you produce less hydrocarbons,\" he added. With battery weight as a main constraint for long-haul electric flights, the industry is currently turning to clean jet fuels for large aircraft. Virgin Atlantic made history last yearby testing out the first transatlantic flightfrom London to New York City using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that is not derived from petroleum. \"The world will always assume something can\u2019t be done \u2026 until you do it,\"read a blog postby founder Sir Richard Branson. \"This flight today shows that sustainable jet fuel can be used as a drop-in replacement for jet fuel \u2014 and it is the only viable solution for decarbonising long-haul flights.\" The UN's International Civil Aviation Organization wants the overall SAF pool to increase from today's levels of less than 1% to5% by 2030. \"We think that's very achievable,\u201d Gavin Towler, chief sustainability officer at Honeywell, told Yahoo Finance. The company licenses its SAF technologies for chemical plants to startups and oil companies. There are numerous ways to produce sustainable aviation fuels, but three have emerged as industry forerunners. One of them uses feedstock. The other is linked to ethanol, which is also used in gasoline blends. A third involves converting carbon dioxide and hydrogen to make aviation fuel. Having one standard for SAFs across the board would help speed up the road to sustainability, Ramanan Krishnamoorti, vice president for energy and innovation at the University of Houston, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cPrice is the biggest challenge that we face today,\" he said. \"The second is also having the same quality of the sustainable aviation fuel across the world.\" Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.
