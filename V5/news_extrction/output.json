        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-stock-market-rally-has-been-all-about-large-caps-080019421.html": "Large-cap stocks have been the clear leader in the 2024 stock market rally. Bespoke Investment Group recently broke the S&P 500's year-to-date performance (^GSPC)into 10 baskets of 50 stocks, organized by the size of their market capitalization value. The top decile of the 50 largest stocks in the index was the only subsector to have outperformed the broader S&P 500 this year. To Bespoke, this shows therecent trend in marketshas generally been \"the smaller the stock, the weaker the returns.\" The move into large-cap stocks comes as investorshave scaled back bets on interest rate cutsfrom the Federal Reserve this year amid sticky inflation reports. The larger stocks have shown more resilience to higher interest rates in an environment where many expect rates to be held high for longer than initially expected. That's partly because large caps have continued to post robust earnings growth. In the first quarter, research from Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha showed earnings for a basket of stocks labeled \"Mega-Cap Growth and Tech\" grew 39% compared with 5.9% year-over-year growth for the S&P 500. The megacap basket includes the\"Magnificent Seven\"tech stocks, among a few other big names like Netflix (NFLX), Visa (V), and Adobe (ADBE). This fundamental case has supported large caps when the outlook for interest rates and the trajectory for economic growthhave become less certain. Meanwhile, small caps have continued to underperform no matter how interest rates move. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Sunday night that this recent market action has him skeptical there will be a strong case for small-cap outperformance anytime soon. \"We view higher rates as a clear headwind to small caps, but we're skeptical that lower rates offer a comparable benefit \u2014 a key reason we remain overweight large caps,\" Wilson wrote. He added, \"The economy is still expanding and trailing S&P 500 earnings growth is finally reaccelerating again led by large cap, high quality stocks.\" Bigger stocks are also winning the artificial intelligence trade. Bespoke analyzed a group of AI ETFs to identify nearly 200 stocks that are frequently in indexes related to the AI trade. The team found that within those indexes, stocks with a market cap over $1 trillion have returned a combined average of 41% this year, while those with market caps under $1 trillion have gained just 0.42% year to date. Notably, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the only US stocks with market caps above $1 trillion. \"The early days of the AI boom were pretty broad, but recently it has been the mega-caps, driven primarily by NVIDIA, that has been the only game in town,\" Bespoke's team wrote in its Monday note.

(NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. The Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market\u2019s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI. \u00a0SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank\u2019s CFO, who said the bank\u2019s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a \u201cbreak from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.\u201d In this backdrop it\u2019s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what\u2019s happening in the AI space. In this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can\u2019t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 124 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0shares recently slipped after Morgan Stanley\u2019s Joseph Moore downgraded the stock to Equalweight from Overweight, saying the Street\u2019s expectations from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0AI business are \u201ctoo high.\u201d The analyst went on the say that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0is expensive when compared to peers like NVDA and AVGO. However, the analyst retained his $176 price target on the stock. Average analyst estimate for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0is\u00a0$187.2, which presents an upside potential of 17%. Wall Street analysts expect Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0to grow 32.50% this year and 59% next year. For the next five years the growth will then moderate to 32% on a per-annum basis, which is still high. Based on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a02025 EPS forecast, the stock is trading at around 28.6X forward P/E ratio, which isn\u2019t high given Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMD)\u00a0growth trajectory and catalysts. Meridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in itsfourth quarter 2023 investor letter: \u201cAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel\u2019s. We invested on the the belief that AMD\u2019s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD\u2019s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.\u201d Overall, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-beats-microsoft-return-worlds-134833825.html": "By Sruthi Shankar (Reuters) - Apple once again became the world's most valuable company on Wednesday, dethroning Microsoft from the top spot, as the iPhone maker pushed ahead in a race to dominate artificial intelligence technology. Its shares jumped nearly 4% to a record $215.04, giving it a market valuation of $3.29 trillion. Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $3.24 trillion, falling behind Apple for the first time in five months. The stock surge comes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit a record high on fresh signs of cooling inflation. Apple shares had added more than 7% in the previous session, a day after it unveiled a range of AI-enabled features and software enhancements for its devices, a move that several analysts said would power iPhone sales. At Apple's annual developer conference on Monday, executives, including CEO Tim Cook, touted how voice assistant Siri would be able to interact with messages, emails, calendar as well as third-party apps. \"All those questions about Apple lagging from an AI technology standpoint were answered at the Worldwide Developers Conference,\" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \"Some of the specifics about AI capabilities that are going to be integrated into the upcoming iPhones made it very apparent that there will clearly be demand for a significant upgrade cycle.\" The tech giant has trailed rivals such as Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet in the red-hot field of AI, a reason why its shares underperformed this year compared to its peers. Some of the concerns over its weak share performance, however, eased after Apple beat market expectations for quarterly results and forecast in May, and unveiled a record $110 billion buyback plan. Apple's shares have risen about 12% so far in 2024, while Microsoft has added about 16% and Alphabet nearly 28%. AI chip leader Nvidia, which briefly overtook Apple's market value last week, is up a whopping 154% this year. Nvidia last had a market value of $3.11 trillion. Tesla is the only other 'Magnificent Seven' stock that has fared worse than Apple this year, with an about 30% slide.

If you wish to look at our detailed rankings, you can go to the25 Most Influential Cities in the World. Cities play a very important role in the world economy, serving as hubs for economic development, knowledge creation, and governance. According to Oxford Economics, the top 1,000 cities worldwide contributed to60% of global GDP and housed over 30% of the global population as of 2023. The significance of cities is going to increase even further in the coming years. In fact, before the COVID-19 pandemic, 70 cities had surpassed their countries in terms of GDP or employment growth over a ten-year period. It is alsoprojectedthat urban populations will expand significantly, more than doubling by 2050. By then, nearly 70% of the world's population is expected to reside in urban areas. However, the trend in urbanization differs among countries. The UN predicts that 93% of the upcoming increase in urban population is projected to take place in developing nations. The majority of this growth will be concentrated in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, contributing to 54%, 32.5%, and 6.8% of the overall urban population expansion, respectively. Developing countries are not only expected to experience population growth but are also expected to play a more significant role in the global economy. In fact, areportby Forbes shows that BRICS currently accounts for more than 32% of the global GDP, which is slightly higher than the G7's 30%. With the inclusion of new member countries, this bloc is projected to account for 36% of the world\u2019s GDP, while also accommodating half of the global population. Hence, lists of the world\u2019s leading cities increasingly feature entries from developing countries. A strong business sector and the presence of notable companies also play an important role in increasing the influence of any city. For example, Xiaomi Corporation (HKSE:1810.HK), based in Beijing and traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, is listed among the Time100 Most Influential Companies of 2024. Xiaomi Corporation (HKSE:1810.HK) introduced its SU7 electric sedan in March, which was the first car produced by a telecommunications company. The Chinese tech giant, known for its wide range of products including computers, wearable devices, robot vacuums, scooters, and phones does not think of this venture as unconventional. Rather, Xiaomi Corporation (HKSE:1810.HK) considers the SU7 to be an enhancement of customers' electronic lifestyles. This innovative vehicle can connect to smart home devices, enabling drivers to manage household lighting and appliances from behind the wheel. Initially targeting the Chinese market, Xiaomi Corporation (HKSE:1810.HK) set an affordable price point for the base model at around $30,000 to outdo the Model 3's pricing strategy. Surpassing expectations, the company received over 70,000 orders for the SU7 within less than one month of its release. To shortlist the 25 most influential cities in the world, we referred to various credible sources such asForbes, the World EconomicForum, OxfordEconomics, and BusinessInsider. For the purpose of ranking the cities, we looked at the Global Power City Index (GPCI) byMoriMemorial Foundation\u2019s Institute of Urban Development.

Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison also noted that\u00a0Oracle's cloud infrastructure and data centers are also being used by Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and xAI, an AI company founded by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk. For the quarter ended on May 31st, total revenue grew 3.3% to $14.29 billion, which was below LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$14.55 billion.\u00a0Cloud infrastructure alone brought in $2 billion, as renting of computing power and storage increased 42%. Although it remains much smaller compared to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service, Oracle\u2019s cloud unit is growing faster.\u00a0The cloud services and license support segment grew 9%, generating revenue of $10.23 billion. Cloud and on-premises licenses business contracted 15% as it brought in revenue of $1.84 billion. Adjusted profit was $1.63 per share, also short of LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$1.65.\u00a0Net income amounted to $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share. Partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud show undeniable cloud momentum The aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to\u00a0extend Azure Al to\u00a0Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\u00a0(OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl.\u00a0Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure.\u00a0As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges.\u00a0Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle\u2019s cloud database growth. For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%. Oracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024. For the current fiscal year ending in May 2025,\u00a0Catz\u00a0expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads,\u00a0adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand. Shifting focus away from weak Q4 financials. Meanwhile,\u00a0Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st.\u00a0Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies\u00a0analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won\u2019t last forever.

Interestingly, some countries around the globe have been much more successful in their efforts to rejuvenate tourism than others. Data shows that recovery in tourism has not been uniform across the globe. In fact, the Middle East became the first region to surpass pre-pandemic volumes in 2023. The region hosted 87.1 million international tourists last year, which was 22% higher than 2019. Tourism volumes in the Middle East have been even more impressive during Q1 2024, with 36% more international tourists visiting in comparison to Q1 2019. In contrast, the Asia and Pacific region has been lagging behind in the effort to rebuild its tourism industry. In 2023, international tourist arrivals in the region were recorded at just 65% of pre-pandemic volumes. In comparison, Europe, the Americas, and Africa recovered to at least 90% of tourist volumes recorded in 2019. Despite its sluggish recovery, tourism in Asia has managed to show some signs of progress during the last quarter. In Q1 2024, the region hosted 82% of international tourists in comparison to Q1 2019. Tourism in the region has also been aided by the resurgence of tourism in China. China was the first country to experience the devastating impact of COVID-19, causing it to implement travel restrictions as early as January 2020. Now, it has finally relaxed much of the travel restrictions that continued to be implemented post-lock down. The country has also introduced many visa-free entry policies for several EU nations and countries such as Malaysia and Thailand. Our article on theMost Underrated Cities in Africa to Visit in 2024how several nations in Africa have introduced similar waivers on visas to capitalize on the growing demand for tourism. However, data from Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) shows that factors such as sustainability, wellness, and enrichment are the real driving factors behind tourism in 2024. According to Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE), 70% of tourists are willing to sacrifice convenience to be more sustainable. To capitalize on the demand for sustainable tourism, Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE) joined a sustainable travel coalition led by Travalyst in 2022 and launched a global sustainability strategy in the same year. Similarly, demand for self-care tourism has also increased in the wake of the pandemic, withwellness tourismexpected to grow beyond $1 Trillion in revenue in 2024. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) reports the number one reason people are traveling in 2024 is to rest and recharge, with many looking to improve their mental and physical wellness while on vacation. Consequently, resorts such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) have ramped up their offerings in the wellness space. In 2020, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) launchedTempo, a wellness-focused hotel chain that is suited to the demands of its health-conscious vacationers. Similarly, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR), under its JW Marriott brand, launched a \u201cStay in the Moment\u201d campaign in the Asia-Pacific market. This campaign provides experiences focusing on personal well-being and enrichment. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) has placed immense focus on the Asia-Pacific market in recent years, despite tourism in the region failing to rejuvenate since the pandemic. In 2023, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) celebrated itsmilestoneof reaching1000 hotels in the region. Summer 2024 has the potential to be a record-breaking season in terms of tourism for many countries around the world. With its impressive portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region, Marriott could finally reap the rewards of its investments in this market. In Q1 2024, the company\u2019s RevPAR grew by 4% YoY worldwide. However, in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China) the RevPAR grew by 17%. As a result, CFO Leeny Oberg revealed that the company is raising its full-year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS expectations, drawing confidence from its IMF (incentive management fee) revenues in international regions. It should be noted that the company fell just short of adjusted diluted EPS expectations of $2.17 in Q1 2024, instead posting an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.13. Irrespective, share prices remained relatively consistent after the company reported its quarterly financial results on the 1stof May, ending the month at $231.17 (MAR share price on May 1stwas $233.86). The hotel's strategic expansion and strong development pipeline demonstrates its potential for growth in the upcoming quarters.

Germany underwent a recession in 2023 and experienced a 0.2% decline in its GDP. However, it showed signs of a gradual recovery in the first quarter of 2024 with a 0.2% quarter-on-quarter growth amidst the economic headwinds. Germany is one of therichest countries in the worldwith a GDP of $5.69 trillion. The consumer front in Germany has also shown signs of recovery. The European Commissionreportedthat purchasing power increased significantly in the country in 2023. This trend is anticipated to continue driven by eased inflation, leading to an increase in household income. Due to improved financing conditions, private consumption will also return to pre-pandemic levels in 2025. However, trade is projected to have a minor contribution toward economic growth in 2025. The labor market reached a record high, defying the economic downturn in 2023. A staggering 83.6% of the population aged 20 to 64 contributed to Germany's workforce in 2023. This resilience by the labor market is also translated into the low unemployment rate which is expected to remain stable around 3%. Despite the economic headwinds, foreign investments reached a record high in Germany in 2023. On May 14, Reutersreportedthat foreign companies increased their investment in the country, recording a staggering 34.8 billion euros compared to Europe where foreign investment declined by 7.4%. A significant portion of the investment projects in Germany are targeted toward renewable energy and digitalization. The United States is the top investor in the country followed by Switzerland and China. Germany is one of the top 5countries with the highest number of billionaires in 2024. There are 140 billionaires in Germany, as of 2024. It is one of the largest economies with a total wealth of $17.42 trillion, as of 2022. With a wealth per capita of $256,179, the country is also one of therichest countries in the world by per capita net worth. According to asurveyby Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany has uneven wealth distribution according to European standards. However, the wealth inequality declined slightly between 2017 and 2021. Still, the wealthiest 10% in Germany possess around 56% of the total net wealth in the country. The automotive industry in Germany is a key driver of its economy. The Germany Trade and Investreportsthat the auto industry in Germany produced more than 15.6 million vehicles in 2021, with the highest R&D spending in its domestic industry. The country generated foreign market revenue of 274 billion euros in 2021, exemplifying the dominance of Germany in the global market. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (OTC:BMWYY), or BMW AG, is one of the top leaders in the automotive industry globally and in Germany, employing nearly 155,000 employees as of December 2023. It is majority-owned by the richest woman in Germany, Susanne Klatten, and her brother, Stefan Quandt. BMW AG (OTC:BMWYY) delivered over 2.5 million BMW, MINI, and Rolls-Royce vehicles to its customers in 2023, up 6.5% year over year. The group is focused on e-mobility and grew its EV deliveries by 74% in 2023, delivered 375,716 fully electric vehicles. For context, Mercedes Benz Group delivered 222,600 electric cars in 2023, up 73% year over year, and Audi delivered 178,429 electric vehicles in 2023, up 51% year over year. Electric vehicle sales accounted for 15% of BMW AG's (OTC:BMWYY) total sales in 2023 and despite a highly competitive environment, the group logged 155.5 billion euros ($168 billion) in annual revenue in 2023, up 12% year over year. The company is also off to a strong 2024 and is seeing robust demand for its electric vehicle line-up. In Q1 2024, BMW AG (OTC:BMWYY) delivered 83,000 fully electric vehicles (13.9% of total sales). The German automaker is focused on product innovation in 2024 and sees record high CapEx and R&D spending throughout the year. Its R&D was 1.97 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in Q1 2024, up 27% year over year from 1.55 billion euros ($1.67 billion). For the full-year, BMW AG (OTC:BMWYY) expects to generate 6 billion euros in free cash flow despite record CapEx and R&D spending. BMW AG (OTC:BMWYY), like other automakers, has faced many challenges over the past few years including inflation, high interest rates, a semiconductor shortage, EV price wars, increased competition from new entrants, and many others. BMW AG (OTC:BMWYY) has been struggling with profitability and missed EPS expectations 5 times over the past 8 quarters. While management sees marginal growth in global deliveries this year and no change in its KPIs, it expects group pretax earnings to fall and EBIT margins to range between 8% and 10%. BMW AG (OTC:BMWYY) operates in a cyclical sector, and within that, it operates in the luxury space. The stock has lost 17% over the past 12 months, and while there may be further near-term downside due to sector and macro headwinds, it may not be that bad of an idea to explore. BMW AG (OTC:BMWYY) has grown both its top and bottom line by a compound annual growth rate of 7% over the past 10 years. The stock is trading at 5 times its forward earnings, but that doesn't mean it's cheap because analysts expect its EPS to contract by 7% and its 5-year average multiple is also 5x. Automotive is not an area we are bullish on at the moment and we currently believe that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, that too within a shorter timeframe.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-shipping-company-world-2024-103245612.html": "We recently compiled a list of the15 Biggest Shipping Companies In The World in 2024and in this article we will look at the biggest shipping company. The global shipping industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, facilitating the movement of goods and services across borders. However, the recent surge in geopolitical tensions has significantly impacted the industry, leading to increased costs, delays, and uncertainty. On March 4, Reuters reported that the global ocean shipping industry, which handles 80% of global trade, entered 2024 with unprecedented levels of risk, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Chris Williamson, the company's chief business economist, noted that this marks the highest degree of risk in the 25 years that the company has been creating these forecasts. Houthi missile and drone attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have caused significant disruptions to cargo delivery and increased shipping costs. Container ship owners are diverting vessels away from the Red Sea and the nearby Suez Canal trade shortcut that handles approximately 30% of global container cargo. The alternate route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope adds five days or more to trips and increases fuel costs by up to $1 million. This has led to a surge in spot shipping rates, which have doubled or tripled on some routes and remain elevated. Climate change is emerging as another significant threat to the shipping industry, posing a major challenge for industry players to adapt and mitigate its impacts. As reported by Reuters on March 18, pressure is mounting for the global shipping industry to pay a fee for its carbon emissions. The European Union, Canada, Japan, and climate-vulnerable Pacific Island states are among 47 countries supporting a proposal to charge a fee for each tonne of greenhouse gas produced by the industry. This move could raise over $80 billion annually to fund low-carbon shipping fuels and support developing countries in their transition. However, opponents like China and Brazil argue that this policy would unfairly penalize trade-reliant emerging economies. A study by Brazil's University of Sao Paulo found that a carbon tax on shipping could reduce GDP in developing countries by 0.13%, with Africa and South America being the most affected regions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is currently discussing this proposal, which could have huge implications for the global shipping industry. To overcome the challenges faced by the shipping industry, some of the largest shipping companies in the world are prioritizing innovation and adaptation. A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S (OTC:AMKBY), one of the biggest shipping companies in the world in 2024, is actively working on minimizing disruptions caused by the Red Sea crisis. Maersk (OTC:AMKBY) operates a fleet of over 700 container vessels and has a total container capacity of more than 4 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs). Its business operations also include 65 terminals in 36 countries. The Danish shipping group is involved in marine transportation, port operations, supply chain management, and warehousing. With operations worldwide, the company has a presence in more than 130 countries. To combat the Red Sea crisis, Maersk (OTC:AMKBY) has diverted its cargoes through the Cape of Good Hope from the Red Sea, which has resulted in an addition of 4,000 miles to its route and has also increased operational expenses. The group is experiencing a 40% increase in fuel costs and they anticipate this situation to persist in the back half of 2024. To mitigate the delays and congestion at its key ports in Asia Pacific, Maersk (OTC:AMKBY) is turning to air cargo transportation services and exploring a hybrid approach. The group is routing sea freight from ports in Asia Pacific to the Jebel Ali port in the UAE and is later transferring it for air transportation to major airports across the globe via airports in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. Moreover, Maersk (OTC:AMKBY) has also established new routes from China to Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan, which are now operational. Maersk (OTC:AMKBY) is also building new vessels that run on green fuels. In 2023, the company introduced Laura Maersk, the first of its new green fuel-powered fleet of container vessels. On May 8, \u00a0the company's green methanol-powered vessel, Ane Maersk, arrived at the Jebel Ali Port in Dubai. Ane Maersk is the first of 18 large vessels that Maersk plans to add to its fleet in 2024 and 2025. The new vessels feature an innovative design with the bridge and accommodation placed at the front, allowing for increased cargo capacity and reduced fuel consumption per container. This milestone underscores Maersk's commitment to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing its environmental impact by 2040.

Methodology In this article, we compiled a list of the 15 biggest shipping companies in the world in 2024. To collect data for our list, we consulted AXSMarine's Alphaliner database.

Check out all 12Best Places to Retire in Las Vegas. According to a Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) study, baby boomers are the main home-buyers in the country. Born between 1946 and 1964, this generation is one of the wealthiest on the planet, with their net worth falling between $970,000 and $1.2 million, as per Fortune. Between July 2021 and July 2022, they made up a whopping 40% of all home-buyers in the US. Moreover, they have been reported to be moving towards the sunbelt ever since the pandemic, downsizing their homes and buying a place to spend their golden years. The Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) study reveals five cities to be the most popular destinations for these baby boomers, one of which is Las Vegas. While Sin City maybe attracting the Baby Boomer generation to itself, one often wonders ifLas Vegas is a good area to retire in. The influx of people in large numbers reveals that it is. \"Domestic migration continues to be a key theme shaping the housing market. While rising interest rates are dampening home-buying demand in the near term, the housing market in cities where Millennials and Baby Boomers are moving could see strength in the longer term as the former enter prime home-buying age and the latter downsize their houses\". -Anna Zhou, economist for Bank of America Institute. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of thelargest banks in the US by asset size in 2024. As of December 31, 2023, their reported total assets were worth $3.180 trillion. The company also happens to be one of thetop favorite stocks of Warren Buffet, one of the most successful investors of all time. It has never missed a dividend in the past 25 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks. While we at Insider Monkey recognize the potential of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock and its ability to consistently generate returns & dividends, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Coming back to the baby boomer housing scenario, the above mentioned trends continue to shape the housing market and cost of living even today. As per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), the median price of a home in Las Vegas is $440,000, up 7.3% since last year. Moreover, Zillow reports the median rent for all apartments in Las Vegas to be $1,638, whereas Best Places reveals the cost of living in the area to be an estimated 10% higher than the national average. Nevertheless, Las Vegas is one of thebest places to retirein the US. As such, there aremany pros and cons of retiring to Las Vegas. One of the main advantages of retiring to the Sin City has got to be its world-class entertainment scene. From shows and concerts to a happening nightlife, seniors who love to enjoy their golden years love the Las Vegas area. The warm and dry climate is another plus of moving here, and so is its cost of living. While a bit higher than the national average, retiring to Las Vegas is cheaper than places such as New York. The Red Rock Canyon, Lake Mead, and Mount Charleston are some of the top nearby attractions for engaging in recreational opportunities. There are abundant 55+ communities for seniors to choose from, offering a wide range of amenities. Finally, the healthcare system is also a major plus. Some good hospitals in the Las Vegas area are Summerlin Hospital Medical Center, Mountain View Hospital, and Elite Medical Center. However, just like any other place, there are some cons of retiring to the Las Vegas area. For instance, Las Vegas heavily relies on tourism and can come off as crowded, especially near the strip. Summers can be quite hot, and the gaming culture isn\u2019t quite aligned with everyone\u2019s lifestyle preferences.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-liberal-state-us-162333024.html": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Liberal States in the US and in this article, we will talk about20 Most Liberal states in the US. The United States has been a major proponent and defender of liberal values globally, although its commitment to upholding these values has fluctuated over time. Since the 1930s, modern liberalism in the US has been associated with support for a regulated market economy, expansion of civil and political rights, and government programs aimed at promoting social welfare and equality. Key achievements of this liberal tradition include the New Deal policies under Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Great Society programs under Lyndon B. Johnson, and landmark civil rights legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The University of Richmond claims that political usage of the term \"liberalism\" dates back to the early 1800s. It first appeared in 1810\u20131811 when a group of Spanish Cortes dubbed themselves \"Liberales\" and promoted an open, tolerant society with less intervention. The phrase then made its way to France and Great Britain, where, by the 1840s, the Whigs had transformed into the Liberal Party. According to Pew Research Centerresearch, conservatives want big homes in rural or small-town settings, preferably with other members of their own religious community. Liberals, on the other hand, want thriving urban environments with compact housing, pedestrian-friendly streets, and a diversified populace. According to the survey, 35% of consistently conservative people prefer small towns, while 41% of people prefer living in rural areas. On the other hand, 46% of consistently liberal people would rather live in the city. In both groups, about 20% prefer living in the suburbs. As themost liberal state in the union, Massachusetts has always supported the Democratic Party in presidential elections since 1964, with 35% of its citizens identifying as liberal. Only 16% of Massachusetts lawmakers' votes in 2020 reflected conservative viewpoints on topics including corporate tax increases and abortion access, according to a report by the Center for Legislative Accountability, making them the most liberal in the country. Companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), among others, are known for their liberalism. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) supports LGBTQ+ rights and offers comprehensive benefits for transgender employees. In 2022, Amazon's global activities resulted in a total tax contribution of $77.99 billion across different regions. Amazon has invested over $530 billion in the U.S. over the past decade, creating 1.6 million indirect jobs. Small and medium businesses make up 60% of Amazon's product sales, creating an estimated 2.2 million jobs. In Q1 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s net sales increased 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion and AWS revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% year-over-year, up from 13.2% in Q4 2023. Their Advertising revenue grew over 23% year-over-year to $11.7 billion in the same period. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has often been portrayed as aprogressive\u00a0and liberal company, particularly after its controversial ad campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick in 2018.

For example, if a state has 35% of its population identifying as liberal and 21% as conservative, the ratio is calculated as 35/21, resulting in approximately 1.6. States with the highest ratios are considered the most liberal. Liberal-to-Conservative Ratio: 1.60 Massachusetts tops the list for being themost liberal state in the US. 35% of the state's population identifies as liberals which is the highest in the country.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-nasdaq-nvda-cheaper-002007659.html": "AI prodigy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0stock has risen colossally from$15 (split-adjusted) when I first wrote about itto almost $121 currently. It surpassed Apple to become the world\u2019s second-highest-valued company. I also predicted thatNVDA could go for a stock split, and it just did. The stock continues to surprise with newer highs (+144% YTD) after its spectacular earnings beat. Nonetheless, my thesis remains intact: NVDA is attractive for the long term based on its undeniable AI leadership and exponential AI growth potential. On May 22, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q1 result, driven by robust continued computing and accelerated generative AI demand momentum.Adjusted earnings of $6.12 per sharehandily beat the consensus estimate of $5.60 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+461%) than the Fiscal Q1-2024 (ended April 2023) figure of $1.09 per share. Impressively, Q1 revenue jumped 262% year-over-year to $26.04 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $24.59 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 13.8 percentage points to an unbelievably new high at 78.4% from 64.6% a year ago. Concurrent with the earnings report, the company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split. While the stock split does not change the valuation or the performance of the company, it does mean that NVDA will now be more available to retail investors, creating short-term momentum in the share price. On top of that, the company hiked its quarterly cashdividendby 150% to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis. NVDA shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis today. Markedly, this is Nvidia\u2019s sixth stock split. Importantly, NVDA\u2019s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, soared 427% year-over-year to $22.6 billion. The segment makes up 86% of the firm\u2019s total revenue. As expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that \u201cbusiness in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past.\u201d Looking ahead, the Q2 guidance appears promising, with itsrevenuesexpected to hover around $28 billion, ahead of expectations. However, adjusted gross margins are forecast to be around 75.5% versus 77% projected for Q1 three months ago. Nonetheless, it still remains far ahead of chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), with gross profit margins of 50.6% and 41.5%, respectively, in the past year. Nvidia continues to innovate in the AI\u00a0space, keeping its leadership status quo intact by innovating newer, cutting-edge AI products. NVDA\u2019s latest GPUs & CPUs, backed by both its hardware and software capabilities, remain top-of-the-line in the AI industry.\u00a0As the preferred choice in high-computing data centers worldwide, NVDA commands superior pricing power. The scope and expansion of AI continue to grow manifold, and the demand clearly continues to outpace supply. During the earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, \u201cBeyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, Sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\u201d At theComputex conferenceheld in Taiwan on June 2, Huang unveiled Nvidia\u2019s latest AI architecture, Rubin, which is expected to begin shipping in 2026. This follows the launch of the Blackwell platform less than three months ago in March. Blackwell, designed for high-performance AI and scientific computing, succeeded the Hopper platform, which was optimized for AI inference and training and launched less than a year ago. Blackwell is now in full production and expected to ramp up in Q3. Meanwhile, Hopper continues to see strong demand. Further, Huang said that NVDA will launch a new family of chips every year, compared to its initial plan of releasing new models every two years. This accelerated pace of innovation and rapid transition to newer models and chip enhancements has allowed Nvidia to retain a 70% to 95% market share (according to estimates from Mizuho Securities) in the AI chip market. However, competition in the AI space is heating up. Competitors likeAMD (with its Ryzen AI 300)andIntelare launching newer AI chips at lower prices. Despite this, Nvidia\u2019s first-mover advantage in AI technology keeps AMD and Intel several quarters behind NVDA. Having overtaken Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation. On the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive. Currently, it\u2019s trading at a forward P/E ratio of 44.7x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, NVDA\u2019s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, AMD, is trading at a forward P/E of 47.8x,\u00a0while Netherlands-based semiconductor stock\u00a0ASML (NASDAQ:ASML)\u00a0is trading at a forward P/E of 51x. Interestingly, its current valuation is still hovering around its five-year average of 46.6x despite the earnings, margins, and stock price having grown multifold. These are attractive price levels and likely present a reasonable buying opportunity, in my view, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan Nvidia. NVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 37 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, theaverage Nvidia stock target price of $123.62suggests that the shares will return 2.2% over the next year. Nvidia has climbed to become the second most valuable stock in the world, with a market cap of $2.98 trillion, a significant leap from just under $100 billion less than five years ago. NVDA has earned its stature by leading the AI industry to unprecedented heights. Despite increasing competition, NVDA continues to enjoy a\u00a0sizeable market share in the AI industry, which will continue to grow by leaps and bounds in the coming years.\u00a0Therefore, I will continue to buy NVDA at current levels. While some critics warn of waning demand after the initial wave of AI installations, I believe this is at least several quarters away. Therefore, I will continue to buy NVDA at current levels.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-drama-intensifies-as-tesla-shareholders-vote-on-his-56b-pay-package-heres-whats-at-stake-145645586.html": "Today Tesla shareholders will finally answer a $56 billion question hanging over the company: Can CEO Elon Musk keep his record-breaking pay? While Musk posted late Wednesday night that the voteswere trending for passageof his pay package, official word won't come down until later today \u2014 though Tesla stock was up nearly 7% in early trading. Securing Musk's compensation, if truly passed by investors, did not come without a battle. Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins!\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f Thanks for your support!! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0fpic.twitter.com/udf56VGQdo \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk)June 13, 2024 To review: Musk\u2019s all-stock pay package, awarded in 2018, has been embroiled in controversy and was struck down by a Delaware court earlier this year, with the judge finding that Tesla\u2019s boarddidn\u2019t act \u201cin the best interests\u201d of Teslashareholders by approving the $56 billion award. Since then, Musk and Tesla\u2019s board, led by chair Robyn Denholm, havebeen advocating rather forcefullyfor Tesla shareholders to approve a newly submitted pay package, which is very similar to the original 2018 award invalidated by the judge. On the eve of those results, Musk and Tesla are getting assailed from a number of fronts. Late Tuesday the Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI) filed another lawsuit in Delaware accusing Musk and his brother Kimbal Muskof selling a combined $30 billion of stock using inside information\u2014 that being the two knew the proceeds would be used to fund Elon's purchase of Twitter (now X) and that two brothers were also aware that Tesla's vehicle deliveries had fallen below projections. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Elon Muskhas joined recent meetingswith proxy adviser Glass Lewis and investors, including \"Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock, alongside Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm and others,\" to drum up support for Musk's pay package. If that wasn't enough, the Journal alsopublished an expos\u00e9 late Tuesday nightalleging Musk had numerous inappropriate relationships with employees at SpaceX, the rocket and spaceship company Musk founded and where he still serves as CEO. Then separately on Wednesday eight former SpaceX employeesfiled a lawsuitagainst Musk for sexual harassment and retaliation in California state court, alleging that Musk created an \"unwelcome hostile work environment\" based on his behavior, among other allegations. Theongoing drama around the votehas been building for weeks now. The battle to get Musk's pay package passed picked up steam last week when Denholm submitted an open letter urging shareholder approval of Musk\u2019s compensation package. \"Fairness and respect require that we honor the collective commitment we made to Elon \u2014 a commitment that was, and fundamentally still is, about retaining Elon\u2019s attention and motivating him to focus on achieving astonishing growth for our company,\"Denholm wrotein her letter. Denholm\u2019s choice of words \u2014 \"retaining Elon\u2019s attention and motivating him\" \u2014 raised eyebrows, as most independent board chairs generally do not pen open letters urging shareholder approval of management pay packages, let alone claiming the compensation is needed to keep the CEO motivated. Even before the 2018 pay package was invalidated by the Delaware court, Musk threatened shareholders about his divided attention, as he is in charge or spends significant amounts of time at SpaceX, X.com (formerly Twitter), and the Boring Co., among other ventures. \"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having 25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can\u2019t be overturned,\"Musk said from his X account in January. \"Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\" Case in point: Tesla recently had to deal with reports that Musk ordered Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips meant for Teslato be divertedto X.com. Muskdefended the moveafter the report's release, claiming Tesla lacked space to use the chips, and they would have sat in a warehouse otherwise. Musk also justwithdrew his lawsuitagainst ChatGPT-maker OpenAI ahead of a hearing on Wednesday, giving no explanation for it. Musk's venture, xAI, is directly competing with OpenAI, among others. Musk\u2019s AI and robotics threat,odd strategic moves and backtracks, and hisown advocacy for his pay packagehave shareholders concerned that he won't care as much about Tesla if he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. Denholm even acknowledged as much, claiming there are \u201cother places\u201d Musk could take his time and energy. \u201cWhat we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time. Nor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world,\u201d she wrote. Musk supporters have doubled down on the argument that his presence is necessary for the future of Tesla. Longtime Tesla shareholderBaillie Gifford said it will vote in favorof Musk's package, according to Bloomberg sources, with the reasoning being the package was aligned with shareholder returns. \u201cElon is the ultimate \u2018key man\u2019 of key man risk,\u201d billionaire Tesla investorRon Baron wrote last week in an open letter. \u201cWithout his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d argue that no other executive is as aligned with shareholders as @elonmusk who committed to no salary, no bonus, no stock comp FOR 10 YEARS, unless he created tremendous value for @Tesla shareholders,\u201d ARK Invest founder and CEO Cathie Woodposted on Xlate last week. Conversely,proxy adviser firm Glass Lewisurged shareholders to vote against Musk\u2019s compensation, arguing that the \u201cexcessive size\u201d of the award and the dilutive effect of it on existing shareholders were major concerns. ISS, the other major proxy adviser firm,recommended that shareholdersvote down the package as well. While afew smaller shareholder groupscame out against Musk's pay package, one big one weighed in against Musk over the weekend \u2014 Norway's $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund. \"We remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,\" Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM),the operator of the fund, said. The fund, which also opposed Musk's pay package in 2018, holds a $5.6 billion stake encompassing 31.57 million shares, or 0.99% of all shares outstanding, making it Tesla's seventh-largest shareholder, per Capital IQ. And earlier this week, the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) alsosaid it will vote againstMusk's pay package, with the pension fund's chief investment officer telling CNBC the stock awards were \"ridiculous.\" CalSTRS owns around 4.7 million shares of Tesla. Other large funds that own the largest Tesla stakes \u2014 Vanguard, BlackRock (BLK), and State Street, among others \u2014 have not commented on Musk's pay package. The drama could be much ado about nothing when the votes are counted, however, with shareholders expected to give Musk what wants. \"[Musk\u2019s pay package] has been an area of hot button contention among some investors but we would expect the 2018 package will be overwhelming [sic] reapproved,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives predicted in a note to investors late last week. While approval of the pay package will remove one \"overhang\" on Tesla stock, Ives believes Tesla needs Musk more than ever to navigate the company through a crucial time. \"Musk needs to commit all AI initiatives will be under the Tesla hood and will be not be separated,\" Ives said, reiterating his Outperform rating and $275 price target. CFRA's Garrett Nelson believes the vote will be closer than expected. \"Clearly, the Board is concerned about the vote given its shareholder outreach efforts,\" Nelson said in a statement to Yahoo Finance, writing that the vote will likely come in below the 73% approval the plan received in 2018. Nelson added: \"We have long argued that one of the primary reasons the stock trades at such a massive premium to the rest of the industry is the innovation of Musk. If the pay package were to be voted down, it could increase uncertainty regarding the future direction and leadership of the company.\u201d Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semi-nyse-tsm-best-192354947.html": "We recently compiled the list of the15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldman Sachsusing the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other hardware stocks. The soaring popularity of artificial intelligence for consumer and business applications has injected fresh life into the computing industry. If we're to rewind the hands of time and go back to 2022, the stock market environment was considerably different from what it is now. All major technology stocks, including those that are responsible for making chips that power AI workloads were down by double digit percentages in the wake of breakneck inflation and rising interest rates. Fast forward to 2024 and the rise in valuations seems to have no end in sight. One bank that's quite optimistic about artificial intelligence is Goldman. Goldman's analyst teams are among the best in the world, and they spend countless hours analyzing stocks and industries for the right set of picks that could disrupt the industry. On this front, Goldman came out with a note recently that outlined a new beginning for the computer hardware industry. According to the bank, the introduction of AI has necessitated a global shift to new hardware that can support the technology. In its note, the bank's analysts shared: During the pandemic, the tech hardware industry peaked as the majority of work-from-home employees purchased equipment. The space currently has fully unwind this cycle and we notice stocks like HPQ trading at 9x their 2025 earnings estimates. Most PCs purchased during the pandemic are expected to be replaced soon. We expect discernable new features of AI, enhanced security, and stronger computational power in upcoming PC and mobile device models, incentivizing the US consumer to spend more on newer equipment than historically, creating an unusually stronger cycle. Goldman also created a basket of stocks where the highest weighted stock has an 8% weight and there are 20 stocks in the basket. According to Goldman analyst Faris Mourad: The basket is composed of technology hardware stocks that may benefit from PC and mobile device renovations that could include AI features. The basket can trade up to $250m in one day with no name exceeding 10% of ADV. Considering this optimism, we decided to take a look at the top Goldman's top 15 hardware stock picks. Our Methodology To make our list of the top Goldman Sachs hardware stocks, we used the top holdings of the bank's PC & Mobile Device AI Upgrades basket (GSXUPCAI). For these hardware stocks, we also mentioned hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 135 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is theworld's largest contract chip manufacturer. This places it right at the heart of the AI hardware supply chain as leading players like NVIDIA rely on it to make their products. HSBC is also aware of this, as in a May 2024 analyst note the bank raised Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s share price target to NT$1,025 from NT$993 and kept a Buy rating for the shares. HSBC increased Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s 2024 EPS forecast by 3.5%, and added that the firm's advanced 3-nanometer process technology positions it well in the industry. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s larger peer Intel has a forward P/E of 28.90, and the Taiwanese firm is at level with this due to its ratio of 28.17. This shows that the market expects both firms to grow evenly in the future. Third Point Management mentioned Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said: Today, TSMC derives a relatively small percentage of its revenues from AI processors, largely from NVDA, but we see that percentage quickly rising as AI compute broadens from just the GPU to custom accelerators. With Nvidia\u2019s GPUs costing tens of thousands of dollars, the bulk of which go to Nvidia\u2019s gross profit, hyperscalers are doubling down on their efforts to develop in-house silicon to alleviate AI compute\u2019s economic burden. Google was the first mover to custom accelerators with the TPU almost 10 years ago, and today this is already a multi-billion dollar business for TSMC. Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have all followed Google\u2019s lead and have announced (and in Amazon\u2019s case already mass producing) their own chips. As these products scale, we see TSMC\u2019s AI revenue growing by multiples in the coming years. While TSMC\u2019s fundamental outlook looks bright, the market has concerns which are reflected in the stock\u2019s 10x+ discount to the SOX, the widest in TSMC\u2019s history. The main concern is Intel\u2019s entry into the foundry market. While we commend Intel\u2019s efforts to diversify the global semiconductor supply chain and have admiration for the company\u2019s rich IP and manufacturing expertise, we think it will be difficult for Intel to challenge TSMC\u2019s dominance in foundry. Putting aside the onerous capital requirements necessary to stand up a foundry business (TSMC\u2019s capital budget stands at ~2x Intel\u2019s projected EBITDA), we believe the transition from internal manufacturing to an external foundry will be a difficult one. Intel has spent the past 40+ years tailoring its manufacturing process and transistor design to suit its own narrow product suite. Broadening to a multitude of customized external customer designs across a variety of end markets, in particular mobile, we believe will prove challenging. We believe TSMC has significant untapped pricing power which can be levered to offset (if not expand) its already admirable returns on capital. Overall, TSM ranks 8th among the 15 best hardware stocks to buy according to famed investment bank. You can visit the15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldmanto see the other hardware stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musks-small-investor-army-cheers-182703308.html": "By Abhirup Roy SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Elon Musk's army of small-investor allies took a victory lap on Thursday as the Tesla CEO won a critical shareholder vote for his $56 billion pay package despite opposition from major institutions. Mom-and-pop investors, who hold an unusually high share of the electric-vehicle maker, are typically apathetic toward voting. But in an unusual show of support, many had been campaigning on social media for weeks for the celebrity billionaire CEO's pay to be reinstated after a Delaware judge voided it in January because she found that Musk had improperly controlled the process. \"We have the most awesome shareholder base,\" Musk said at the shareholder meeting after the vote was announced. \"Hot damn, I love you guys,\" he said to a roaring and applauding crowd of investors at the Tesla factory in Austin, Texas. Backing from retail shareholders along with support from some big institutional investors was key to turning the vote in Musk's favor, a source familiar with the preliminary tally told Reuters on Wednesday, after the CEO tipped off on social media platform X that the proposal was garnering huge support. \"Tesla's retail shareholders aren't just passively adding shares to their portfolio. They're participating in running and advancing the company,\" said Omar Qazi in a post on X from the handle @WholeMarsBlog. \"They vote. They tell their friends. It's not just about investing. It's a movement,\" said Qazi who has more than 476,000 followers. Institutional investors have been divided on the issue. While some supported Musk's pay, others such as California Public Employees' Retirement System and proxy firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services urged shareholders to reject the pay package, calling the compensation excessive. \"When both the institutions and the proxy advisory firms are leaning in one direction, it's very rare for the vote to come out the other way,\" John Lawrence, a partner at law firm Baker Botts, told Reuters. \"It shows in this case the company's understanding of the power of social media.\" 'WE HAVE YOUR BACK' Musk enjoys a global fan base for transforming Tesla from a startup to a behemoth and for innovation at his other companies including rocket maker SpaceX. But standing up to powerhouse investors who voted \"no\" on the pay package required more than just a fan base. Social media has been abuzz for weeks with many users, such as Alexandra Merz, who posts on X as @TeslaBoomerMama, calling on people to vote. The efforts prompted some non-U.S. banks and brokerages to allow Tesla investors to vote, which was not previously the case. \"Don't mess with Tesla Retail Shareholders,\" Merz, who attended the meeting and received a standing ovation from investors for her endeavors, posted on X. \"Your votes will help to remedy a true injustice.\" Musk himself has also been actively wooing their support with regular social media posts. He had set up a separate website to educate investors on the proposals, which also included reincorporating the company in Texas, and on how to vote. The company's board sent regular letters to shareholders highlighting Musk's importance to Tesla and alluding to the risks of losing his involvement if the pay package was rejected. Musk even offered tours of Tesla's factory to some investors who voted. The plan worked. About 90% of the retail investors who voted were in favor, Musk said in a post on X over the weekend. The approval is critical as Musk faces an uphill legal fight to convince the Delaware judge who said the Tesla board was \"beholden\" to him, while Tesla might also field fresh lawsuits over the latest vote. Still, small investors assured their continued support. \"Shareholders have spoken, again, and hopefully now our votes can officially count,\" X user Alicia said in a post. \"@elonmusk, we've always believed in you and will continue to do so. We have your back!\" (Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis; Editing by Matthew Lewis) Sign in to access your portfolio",
        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-next-for-teslas-stock-as-shareholders-and-wall-street-pros-weigh-in-113300830.html": "Though Tesla (TSLA) shareholders voted to reinstate Elon Musk's pay package on Thursday afternoon, some investors and analysts told Yahoo Finance they remain skeptical. \u201cThe whole thing is a game of chicken and the shareholders blinked,\u201d early Tesla investor Ibrahim AlHusseini said. \u201cFear of loss is a big motivator and Elon wielded that psychological mechanism to his benefit.\u201d The venture capitalist said he unenthusiastically voted in favor of the $56 billion package. \u201cThe deal was set in 2018 when the milestones seemed virtually impossible and he met them,\" said AlHusseini, who first invested in Tesla in a Series C funding round. \"He made a deal, he delivered, and this is his reward.\u201d Tesla's stock has been down nearly 30% year to date, and dropped roughly 2.5% on Friday. Now that the vote is over, AlHusseini said the stock should remain steady until its next quarterly earnings, where he forecasts that \u201cshares will drop due to another miss on deliveries and margin.\u201d Tesla said 77% voted to support Musk\u2019s pay package. According to the filing, investors who held 1.76 billion shares voted to approve the deal, while 528.9 million shares voted against it. 20.6 million shares did not vote. \u201cI just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys,\u201d Musk said onstage at the shareholder meeting. The package, comprised of options, was originally valued at up to $56 billion but is now worth roughly $46 billion due to a fall in Tesla's market capitalization. In January, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the original pay package, which was approved by 73% of voted shares in 2018, was not negotiated fairly. The vote to reinstate the package doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Musk will get the historic pay. A favorable vote doesn't resolve the legal challenge, and likely won\u2019t change the judge\u2019s mind. Legal experts say the final decision will be tied up with the Supreme Court and Delaware Chancery Court. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was among the shareholders urging for a vote against the package, calls the approval \u201ca mistake.\u201d Lander overseas several pension funds that own about 3.4 million Tesla shares. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how Musk moves forward, if this leads to him focusing on Tesla and developing clear plans for growth,\u201d Lander told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut if it becomes one more battle, distraction, Twitter feud, and more ego \u2014 that won\u2019t be a good thing.\u201d Tesla\u2019s largest outside institutional shareholder, Vanguard, was pivotal in the deal's passage. Vanguard, which holds 7% of Tesla stock, initially voted no in 2018, citing concerns over the size in relation to the company\u2019s performance. Longtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber has questioned Vanguard's move. \"Index funds are supposed to represent the public and often have corporate governance expectations for the companies. It seems a little bit weird that they voted for the pay package and said it aligns with shareholder incentives \u2014 which it does, but at an outrageous value,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. Gerber, who co-founded investment firm Gerber Kawasaki, voted yes in 2018 but advocated for a no this time. He started investing in Tesla in 2014, and his firm holds 332,000 shares as of March 31. \u201cThe package is outrageous and his performance has been horrendous for the last three years,\u201d said Gerber. \u201cBut I believe in elections, so if that's what shareholders want, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Investors also passed a proposal to reincorporate Tesla from Delaware to Texas, which Musk pushed for after the judge voided his pay deal. \u201cThis is part of the distraction problem,\u201d Lander said. \u201cDelaware has a set of relatively conservative laws that are the foundation of shareholder capitalism. To then pack up your marbles and move to Texas because you\u2019re pissy about a judge who said you have to follow the rules, the question is how are you going to reset?\u201d Lander says he sees a strong foundation for Tesla to build on despite some worrying signs, adding that they have no immediate plans to change their investment strategy. \u201cElon deserves a great share of the credit,\u201d Lander said. \u201cNot a $56 billion share, but a very great share.\u201d Analysts say shareholders' decision to restore Musk\u2019s compensation package is a win for investors. Canaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas, who has a Buy rating on the stock, told Yahoo Finance he is \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the vote of confidence in Musk\u2019s leadership. \u201cElon Musk is critical to the success of Tesla in the past and in the future,\u201d Gianarikas explained. Gianarikas said Tesla\u2019s prospects of developing full self-driving set the automaker apart from competitors, putting the company in an \u201cincredibly enviable position.\u201d Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, described the approval as a \u201cpop-the-champagne moment\u201d for Musk and shareholders. He said the pay package approval removes a $20 to $25 overhang on shares. \u201cThis is just the start of the next chapter, as Musk calls it, in the Tesla growth story. It's one of the best disruptive names in the world,\u201d Ives said. \u201cIt's one of the best AI plays in the market.\u201d Ives, who cautions a no vote could have resulted in Musk leaving Tesla, sees Tesla\u2019s valuation surpassing $1 trillion in 2025 as Musk dedicates more time and focus to the automaker. \"You're seeing old-school Musk return now ... Tesla needs Musk and Musk needs Tesla,\u201d Ives added. But Dave Harden, chief investment officer of Summit Global, cautioned against buying Tesla shares at this time. \"It's significant dilution possibilities for shareholders, and it causes one to want to do things that are risky,\" said Harden. The company has not proven itself in AI and robotics, and its major growth burst in EVs has already happened, Harden argues. \"I think that there's going to be much more chatter and much more opportunity to get in when you can see clearly that the growth is going to happen,\" said Harden. \"I would recommend to hold on Tesla and wait. If you're in the shares, I'd probably sell,\" he added. Yasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X@YasminKhorramand onLinkedIn.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-beats-microsoft-return-worlds-134833825.html": "By Sruthi Shankar (Reuters) - Apple once again became the world's most valuable company on Wednesday, dethroning Microsoft from the top spot, as the iPhone maker pushed ahead in a race to dominate artificial intelligence technology. Its shares jumped nearly 4% to a record $215.04, giving it a market valuation of $3.29 trillion. Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $3.24 trillion, falling behind Apple for the first time in five months. The stock surge comes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit a record high on fresh signs of cooling inflation. Apple shares had added more than 7% in the previous session, a day after it unveiled a range of AI-enabled features and software enhancements for its devices, a move that several analysts said would power iPhone sales. At Apple's annual developer conference on Monday, executives, including CEO Tim Cook, touted how voice assistant Siri would be able to interact with messages, emails, calendar as well as third-party apps. \"All those questions about Apple lagging from an AI technology standpoint were answered at the Worldwide Developers Conference,\" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \"Some of the specifics about AI capabilities that are going to be integrated into the upcoming iPhones made it very apparent that there will clearly be demand for a significant upgrade cycle.\" The tech giant has trailed rivals such as Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet in the red-hot field of AI, a reason why its shares underperformed this year compared to its peers. Some of the concerns over its weak share performance, however, eased after Apple beat market expectations for quarterly results and forecast in May, and unveiled a record $110 billion buyback plan. Apple's shares have risen about 12% so far in 2024, while Microsoft has added about 16% and Alphabet nearly 28%. AI chip leader Nvidia, which briefly overtook Apple's market value last week, is up a whopping 154% this year. Nvidia last had a market value of $3.11 trillion. Tesla is the only other 'Magnificent Seven' stock that has fared worse than Apple this year, with an about 30% slide.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracles-cloud-efforts-receive-much-183828385.html": "On Tuesday, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) posted its\u00a0fiscal fourth-quarter earnings\u00a0that were below estimates.\u00a0But, known for its database software, Oracle went all in to expand its cloud infrastructure unit to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison also noted that\u00a0Oracle's cloud infrastructure and data centers are also being used by Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and xAI, an AI company founded by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk. For the quarter ended on May 31st, total revenue grew 3.3% to $14.29 billion, which was below LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$14.55 billion.\u00a0Cloud infrastructure alone brought in $2 billion, as renting of computing power and storage increased 42%. Although it remains much smaller compared to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service, Oracle\u2019s cloud unit is growing faster.\u00a0The cloud services and license support segment grew 9%, generating revenue of $10.23 billion. Cloud and on-premises licenses business contracted 15% as it brought in revenue of $1.84 billion. Adjusted profit was $1.63 per share, also short of LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$1.65.\u00a0Net income amounted to $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share. Partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud show undeniable cloud momentum The aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to\u00a0extend Azure Al to\u00a0Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\u00a0(OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl.\u00a0Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure.\u00a0As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges.\u00a0Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle\u2019s cloud database growth. For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%. Oracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024. For the current fiscal year ending in May 2025,\u00a0Catz\u00a0expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads,\u00a0adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand. Shifting focus away from weak Q4 financials. Meanwhile,\u00a0Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st.\u00a0Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies\u00a0analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won\u2019t last forever.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-fire-steve-jobs-tesla-analysts-react-to-approval-of-elon-musks-pay-package-161905962.html": "Tesla (TSLA) shareholdersreapproved Elon Musk\u2019s record-breaking pay pact, removing a big overhang on the stock as investors blessed the controversial compensation plan. Tesla shares surged the day beforeas Musk all but said passage of the pay planwas afait accompli. And with72% of votes cast by shareholders (excluding Musk and his brother Kimbal) in favorof the $56 billion compensation package, analysts believe clouds around Musk\u2019s future and leadership of the company have dissipated. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in Silicon Valley: \u2018Don\u2019t fire Steve Jobs.\u2019 When someone truly brilliant comes along and chooses to run a company, any sensible investor must do everything in their power to keep them,\u201d wrote DataTrek\u2019s Nick Colas in a note Friday morning. Colas, who cut his teeth as an analyst covering Detroit's Big Three automakers, noted that Open AI broke the rule when its board fired Sam Altman late last year. \u201cTesla shareholders have not made the same mistake,\u201d Colas said. Longtime Tesla bull Dan Ives said it was a \u201cpop-the-champagne\u201d moment for Tesla and Musk, with the company now focused on execution. \u201cThis removes a $20-$25 overhang on the stock in our opinion that has weighed on shares since the head-scratching Delaware ruling set this Twilight Zone soap opera on earlier this year,\u201d Ives wrote in a note late Thursday night. \u201cOur bull case is now $350 heading into the next 12 to 18 months as we believe the next chapter in the Tesla growth story around autonomous and FSD [full self-driving] is now on the near-term horizon set to take Tesla's valuation to north of $1 trillion in 2025 in our view.\u201d CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson also expressed relief in a note on Thursday night. \u201cWe think the news takes a potentially disastrous scenario off the table, in which Musk could have potentially left Tesla and opted to dedicate more time to his other (non-public) companies, which could have triggered a \u2018brain drain\u2019 of top talent and had massive implications for the future of the company (and TSLA\u2019s stock price).\" Musk took the stage and gave a presentation following the passage of the amendments and revealed a slate of products and ambitious goals. \u201cIf I\u2019m not optimistic, this factory would not exist,\u201d Musk said during the presentation, which took place at Tesla's headquarters in Austin, Texas. \u201cI\u2019ve been pathologically optimistic from birth. But this is the reason why every one of these is happening. But, I do deliver in the end. That\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d With the upcoming Tesla robotaxi, Musk said some vehicles in the fleet would be owned by Tesla, while others would be owned by customers. Tesla owners would have something akin to \u201cAirbnb\u201d functionality with their cars, Musk said, giving them control over their vehicles' timing and frequency of participation in the robotaxi network. Research firms like Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest see robotaxis as the main driver for the company's long-term $2,600 price target. \u201cARK estimates that nearly 90% of Tesla\u2019s enterprise value and earnings will be attributed to the robotaxi business in 2029,\u201d ARK analyst Tasha Keeney wrote in a note. \u201cMeanwhile, electric vehicles could approximate a quarter of total sales and ~10% of Tesla\u2019s earnings potential, as we believe the robotaxi business will have much higher margins.\u201d Tesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal event is set for Aug. 8. As for Tesla\u2019s Optimus robot, Musk had more ambitious plans for the rollout. Musk said limited production of the robots was coming this year, and that Tesla itself would have \u201ca few thousand\u201d robots working in Tesla factories next year. This despite the fact Optimus has only been seen recently in a few demonstration videos released by Tesla. \u201cI think Optimus is a $25 trillion dollar market cap situation; it\u2019s an immense amount of work to get there, but we\u2019re moving very fast down that road,\u201d Musk said. The combination of robotaxis, Optimus, and autonomy are part of Musk\u2019s AI-driven focus at Tesla \u2014 which Musk believes is the true way to view Tesla as a company. \u201cWe're not just starting a new chapter for Tesla; we're starting a new book,\u201d Musk said regarding AI and its importance to Tesla \u201cWhat's the new book about? AI/robotics: autonomous driving and Optimus,\u201d Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas wrote on Thursday night. \u201cI could argue [Tesla] is one of the best AI plays in the market, when you look out over the next two, three, four years,\u201d Wedbush\u2019s Ives added in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Further adding to the Tesla story and future growth, Musk revealed in a slide during the presentation that three new Tesla vehicles are planned for the future. Two of them, most likely the robotaxi and cheaper Tesla vehicle,have been mentioned by Tesla as being in the pipeline, but a new van-like product also appears under a sheet. On a slight down note for investors, Musk confirmed near-term demand and sales will still struggle somewhat as the industry goes through a transitionary period. \u201cIt\u2019s tough sledding out there,\u201d Musk said with regard to the EV market, adding that competitors have also been pulling back EV investment and production.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-evs-are-driving-into-mexico--and-its-starting-to-worry-the-us-210133299.html": "Four years after the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) was adopted, Mexico and the US face a common concern: the prospect of cheap Chinese electric vehicles dominating afast-growing marketand undermining regional carmakers like GM (GM), Ford (F), and Tesla (TSLA) in the process. Chinese imports have already begun south of the US border. EV and plug-in hybrid imports jumped 443.9%, by value, in the first quarter compared to the same period the previous year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Overall, 1 in 10 cars sold in Mexico today comes from a Chinese automaker,according to Reuters, with seven new brands entering the market last year alone. \u201cAlmost overnight, we started seeing Chinese cars driving in Mexico,\u201d said Juan Carlos Baker, Mexico's former vice minister for foreign trade. \u201cIn terms of how often you see them and how aggressive their marketing and sales campaigns have been on the part of Chinese cars, that is really pretty evident.\u201d However,calls to curb Chinese EV makersin the US and Mexico haveintensifiedrecently in response to increased imports and investment. According to Baker, who played a critical role in crafting the USMCA, the threat of cheap Chinese EVs flooding the market never emerged as a concern in the two years the trade pact was being negotiated. \"I was present in every single meeting, and I don't remember once Ambassador Lighthizer or anyone at [the US Trade Representative office] saying, 'We need to make these rules of origin or other elements very strict because the Chinese are coming,'\" he said. Although Baker noted that no Chinese carmaker has started manufacturing vehicles in Mexico yet, the country's proximity to the US has raised particular alarm in Washington. Lawmakers fear auto companies will use the country as a backdoor to skirt US tariffs on Chinese car imports, whichPresident Joe Biden raised to 100%last month. BYD has publicly expressed its intention to set up a factory in Mexico; however, itstop executive has insistedthe company has no plans to enter the US market. Foreign markets have taken on increased importance for Chinese firms as the domestic market matures andsales in China slow. The early success of Chinese auto brands in Latin America offers a glimpse into their expansion strategy to build a presence in countries with a large number of free trade agreements, easy access to resources, and a labor force that offers high-quality production at a lower cost. \u201cYou have the perfect match,\u201d said Felipe Munoz, an analyst at automotive intelligence firm Jato. \u201c'We\u2019re talking about [a market with sales projected at] 1.2 million units per year. \u2026 This still has growth potential. And so [Mexico] is attractive for any carmaker.\u201d Mexico is following in the path of Latin America\u2019s largest car market, Brazil, where Chinese firms like BYD (BYDDY) and Great Wall Motor (GWLLF) have already set up manufacturing operations. Brazil \u2014 already the fourth-largest importer of Chinese vehicles \u2014 saw new electric vehicle sales jump 91%, according to data from the Brazilian Association of Electric Vehicles. Chinese automakers BYD, Chery, and Great Wall were three of the top five car brands. In Latin America broadly, Chinese EV makers already have 86% market share, according to Jato, in large part due to aggressive price competition. \u201cThey are applying more or less the same formula in these developing economies in the way that they are becoming the only choice to drive electric because the other ones are very expensive,\u201d said Munoz. \u201cThe regulation and safety standards are not as difficult or complex in those economies.\u201d Still, Chinese car manufacturers' push to export and expand abroad has faced resistance, particularly in developed markets where lawmakers are revisiting existing trade rules in order to prevent a flood of cheap vehicle imports. Concerns in Europe, where Chinese EVs now have roughly 7% market share, according to Jato, prompted an anti-subsidy investigation earlier this year. And on Wednesday, theEU imposed tariffs of up to 38%on Chinese EV imports. That came weeks afterBiden raised the tariff rateon imports of Chinese EVs from 25% to 100%. The tariff rate on lithium-ion batteries and battery parts also increased from 7.5% to 25%. Duo Fu, vice president of battery markets for Rystad Energy, said that the tariff announcements have already started to shift carmakers' investment decisions away from the most developed markets. \u201cWe just don\u2019t think the US is a critical market for the Chinese at the moment,\u201d Fu said. The changing dynamics are also prompting a rethink of the USMCA two years ahead of its scheduled review. Though,new leadership in Mexicoand a potential return of the Trump administration could complicate the approach to tackling Chinese EVs. In the meantime, Baker said Chinese firms are unlikely to find a workaround to be in compliance with stringent automotive rules of origin in the existing trade agreement. The USMCA specifies that automakers have to meet three rules of origin to qualify for preferential treatment under the act: a regional value content requirement for the overall vehicle, a labor value content rule, and thresholds for automobile parts. \u201cThe Rule of Origin on cars on the USMCA is one of the most difficult things to do industry-wise,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThere is no way that you can import a car from China, even if it's just knocked down and they just put it together and add a couple of things here and there and then send it to us and ... try to pass it as a Mexican car. That's just not possible.\u201d Click here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-innovation-solve-ev-challenges-183636332.html": "Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) got the lead on the EV front as a pioneer with Elon Musk\u2019s visionary leadership. But regulatory challenges, competition and an unfavorable macroeconomic environment made the ambitious Tesla focus on making an affordable vehicle while autonomous driving remains work in progress. Tesla aims to build its more cost-effective next-generation EV at its new factory in Mexico. Meanwhile, an Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) company just revealed its solution to an EV challenge and\u00a0Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ:WKSP)\u00a0just got recognized as innovator for its contribution to the automotive sector as it\u2019s about to release the Alpha launch of its eagerly anticipated solar-powered accessories for pickups. Intel just presented a new SOC solution that promises to accelerate EV innovation. The groundbreaking OLEA U310 SoC streamlines e-motor technology, lowering EV design and manufacturing costs. With today\u2019s lunch from\u00a0Silicon Mobility, an Intel Company, the new OLEA U310 system-on-chip (SoC)\u00a0promises to enhance\u00a0the efficiency of the existing battery technology through energy savings at the vehicle level. First for the industry, this next generation technology also promises to improve overall EV performance along with streamlining design and production. Worksport just got rewarded as innovator of the year for its\u00a0pioneering\u00a0advancement\u00a0in the automotive sector.\u00a0The Alpha launch of Worksport\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0SOLIS solar-powered truck bed cover and COR portable battery system is expected as early as this summer. SOLIS will be the first-to-market solar-integrated tonneau cover, reflecting Worksport\u2019s innovative edge. Along with the COR, Worksport is bringing a game-changing power duo to the industry, promising off-grid power on the go. Tapping into the multibillion-dollar market,\u00a0the SOLIS cover\u00a0is\u00a0expected to be compatible with Ford\u00a0Motor (NYSE:F)\u00a0F-Series,\u00a0General Motor (NYSE:GM)-owned\u00a0Chevrolet Silverado, and\u00a0Stellantis (NYSE:STLA)\u00a0Ram pickups, providing options for partnership with Tesla as well. On the other hand, the COR will be offered to all consumers, independently of pickups, as anyone will be able to use it, anywhere, to power almost anything. Therefore, Worksport\u2019s pitch goes beyond building a battery that will extend a pickups\u2019 range, easing the EV range anxiety, but it promises to craft outdoor experiences like no other. 2023 was the year of the electric pickup, with Tesla\u2019s eagerly anticipated Cybertruck finally hitting the road. In May, GM and Ford showed that, thanks to electric pickups and SUV, they managed to refute the EV slowdown. This year, Worksport promises to\u00a0revolutionize the\u00a0automotive accessory\u00a0market with its integrated solar technology\u00a0for pickups and Intel is set to accelerate EV innovation.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-stock-market-rally-has-been-all-about-large-caps-080019421.html": "Large-cap stocks have been the clear leader in the 2024 stock market rally. Bespoke Investment Group recently broke the S&P 500's year-to-date performance (^GSPC)into 10 baskets of 50 stocks, organized by the size of their market capitalization value. The top decile of the 50 largest stocks in the index was the only subsector to have outperformed the broader S&P 500 this year. To Bespoke, this shows therecent trend in marketshas generally been \"the smaller the stock, the weaker the returns.\" The move into large-cap stocks comes as investorshave scaled back bets on interest rate cutsfrom the Federal Reserve this year amid sticky inflation reports. The larger stocks have shown more resilience to higher interest rates in an environment where many expect rates to be held high for longer than initially expected. That's partly because large caps have continued to post robust earnings growth. In the first quarter, research from Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha showed earnings for a basket of stocks labeled \"Mega-Cap Growth and Tech\" grew 39% compared with 5.9% year-over-year growth for the S&P 500. The megacap basket includes the\"Magnificent Seven\"tech stocks, among a few other big names like Netflix (NFLX), Visa (V), and Adobe (ADBE). This fundamental case has supported large caps when the outlook for interest rates and the trajectory for economic growthhave become less certain. Meanwhile, small caps have continued to underperform no matter how interest rates move. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Sunday night that this recent market action has him skeptical there will be a strong case for small-cap outperformance anytime soon. \"We view higher rates as a clear headwind to small caps, but we're skeptical that lower rates offer a comparable benefit \u2014 a key reason we remain overweight large caps,\" Wilson wrote. He added, \"The economy is still expanding and trailing S&P 500 earnings growth is finally reaccelerating again led by large cap, high quality stocks.\" Bigger stocks are also winning the artificial intelligence trade. Bespoke analyzed a group of AI ETFs to identify nearly 200 stocks that are frequently in indexes related to the AI trade. The team found that within those indexes, stocks with a market cap over $1 trillion have returned a combined average of 41% this year, while those with market caps under $1 trillion have gained just 0.42% year to date. Notably, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the only US stocks with market caps above $1 trillion. \"The early days of the AI boom were pretty broad, but recently it has been the mega-caps, driven primarily by NVIDIA, that has been the only game in town,\" Bespoke's team wrote in its Monday note.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-beats-microsoft-return-worlds-134833825.html": "By Sruthi Shankar (Reuters) - Apple once again became the world's most valuable company on Wednesday, dethroning Microsoft from the top spot, as the iPhone maker pushed ahead in a race to dominate artificial intelligence technology. Its shares jumped nearly 4% to a record $215.04, giving it a market valuation of $3.29 trillion. Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $3.24 trillion, falling behind Apple for the first time in five months. The stock surge comes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit a record high on fresh signs of cooling inflation. Apple shares had added more than 7% in the previous session, a day after it unveiled a range of AI-enabled features and software enhancements for its devices, a move that several analysts said would power iPhone sales. At Apple's annual developer conference on Monday, executives, including CEO Tim Cook, touted how voice assistant Siri would be able to interact with messages, emails, calendar as well as third-party apps. \"All those questions about Apple lagging from an AI technology standpoint were answered at the Worldwide Developers Conference,\" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \"Some of the specifics about AI capabilities that are going to be integrated into the upcoming iPhones made it very apparent that there will clearly be demand for a significant upgrade cycle.\" The tech giant has trailed rivals such as Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet in the red-hot field of AI, a reason why its shares underperformed this year compared to its peers. Some of the concerns over its weak share performance, however, eased after Apple beat market expectations for quarterly results and forecast in May, and unveiled a record $110 billion buyback plan. Apple's shares have risen about 12% so far in 2024, while Microsoft has added about 16% and Alphabet nearly 28%. AI chip leader Nvidia, which briefly overtook Apple's market value last week, is up a whopping 154% this year. Nvidia last had a market value of $3.11 trillion. Tesla is the only other 'Magnificent Seven' stock that has fared worse than Apple this year, with an about 30% slide.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peloton-pton-shares-skyrocket-know-150205597.html": "Shares of exercise equipment company Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) jumped 6.9% in the morning session after major indices soared as yields declined after the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of May 2024 came in better than expected at 3.3% year on year (versus analysts\u2019 expectations for 3.4%). The data also revealed that inflation was flat (unchanged) month on month. The inflation results benefitted from a 2% decline in the energy index, while shelter inflation remained sticky (up 0.4% m/m and 5.4% y/y). Sticky inflation is exactly what has delayed the Fed\u2019s planned rate cuts in 2024, with some market participants likely worried that inflation might stay higher for longer. Today\u2019s report eased those worries a bit. As a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market. Is now the time to buy Peloton?Access our full analysis report here, it's free. Peloton's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 67 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 22 days ago, when the stock\u00a0dropped 12.9% on the news that the company announced a refinancing plan to improve its liquidity and shore up its balance sheet. Peloton intends to 1.) Offer $275.0 million of convertible senior notes due 2029 in a private offering 2.) Enter into a $1 billion five-year term loan facility 3.) Enter into a $100.0 million five-year revolving credit facility. The company intends to use the proceeds to repurchase $800m of existing debt and refinance existing loans. Rising interest rates have raised the borrowing cost for companies, and Peloton's debt issuance is likely being met with skepticism by investors. The market could be worried about the cost of managing the debt, including interest payment, given its weak topline growth and unstable business that has recently seen the CEO depart. Also, the company has struggled to generate positive cash flows following the pandemic-era boom in demand, which was a huge tailwind to the business but proved temporary. Finally, there could also be concerns about the potential dilutive effect of the convertible notes, which can be converted to the company's common stock, raising the total share count. Peloton is down 34.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $3.83 per share it is trading 60.9% below its 52-week high of $9.78 from July 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Peloton's shares at the IPO in September 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $148.56. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracles-cloud-efforts-receive-much-183828385.html": "On Tuesday, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) posted its\u00a0fiscal fourth-quarter earnings\u00a0that were below estimates.\u00a0But, known for its database software, Oracle went all in to expand its cloud infrastructure unit to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison also noted that\u00a0Oracle's cloud infrastructure and data centers are also being used by Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and xAI, an AI company founded by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk. For the quarter ended on May 31st, total revenue grew 3.3% to $14.29 billion, which was below LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$14.55 billion.\u00a0Cloud infrastructure alone brought in $2 billion, as renting of computing power and storage increased 42%. Although it remains much smaller compared to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service, Oracle\u2019s cloud unit is growing faster.\u00a0The cloud services and license support segment grew 9%, generating revenue of $10.23 billion. Cloud and on-premises licenses business contracted 15% as it brought in revenue of $1.84 billion. Adjusted profit was $1.63 per share, also short of LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$1.65.\u00a0Net income amounted to $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share. Partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud show undeniable cloud momentum The aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to\u00a0extend Azure Al to\u00a0Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\u00a0(OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl.\u00a0Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure.\u00a0As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges.\u00a0Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle\u2019s cloud database growth. For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%. Oracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024. For the current fiscal year ending in May 2025,\u00a0Catz\u00a0expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads,\u00a0adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand. Shifting focus away from weak Q4 financials. Meanwhile,\u00a0Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st.\u00a0Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies\u00a0analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won\u2019t last forever.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. The Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market\u2019s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI. \u00a0SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank\u2019s CFO, who said the bank\u2019s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a \u201cbreak from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.\u201d In this backdrop it\u2019s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what\u2019s happening in the AI space. In this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can\u2019t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). GongTo/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 165 Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett last week pointed to the concentration of gains phenomenon on the market, saying if we remove the \u201cBig Ten\u201d stocks from the equation, the S&P 500\u2019s gain so far this year shrinks to just 3.6%. This \u201cBig Ten\u201d group also includes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG). Another latest story around Alphabet Inc Class C\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0making waves is Bank of America\u2019s industry checks in the search engine market which found that Alphabet is still the market leader, with a whopping 95% share, with Bing\u2019s search coming in at just 0.7%. BofA\u2019s Justin Post said Alphabet Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0AI Overviews had a role to play here: \u201cAfter a consecutive eight months of decline, Google\u2019s US Search market share increased m/m in May, which could suggest AI Overviews are aiding query growth and usage,\u201d Post said. Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a02025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis. Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in itsApril 2024 investor letter: \u201cAlphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 \u2013 showing meaningful progress in the company\u2019s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company\u2019s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it\u2019s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\u201d Overall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. While we acknowledge the potential Alphabet, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

On the other hand, the company expects next quarter's revenue to be around $5.36 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $4.48 per share, improving from its profit of $2.82 per share in the same quarter last year. Is now the time to buy Adobe?Find out in our full research report. Revenue:$5.31 billion vs analyst estimates of $5.29 billion (small beat) EPS (non-GAAP):$4.48 vs analyst estimates of $4.39 (2% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2024is $5.36 billion at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $5.40 billion EPS (non-GAAP) Guidancefor Q3 CY2024 is $4.53 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $4.47 Gross Margin (GAAP):88.7%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flowof $1.90 billion, up 67% from the previous quarter Net New Digital Media ARR:$487 million, above analyst estimates of $434 million Billings:$4.89 billion at quarter end, up 3.5% year on year Market Capitalization:$206 billion \u201cAdobe achieved record revenue of $5.31 billion driven by strong growth across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud,\u201d said Shantanu Narayen, chair and CEO, Adobe. One of the most well-known Silicon Valley software companies around, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a leading provider of software as service in the digital design and document management space. The demand for rich, interactive 2D, 3D, VR and AR experiences is growing, and while the ubiquitous metaverse might still be more of a buzzword than a real thing, what is real is the demand for the tools to create these experiences, whether they are games, 3D tours or interactive movies. As you can see below, Adobe's revenue growth has been unremarkable over the last three years, growing from $3.84 billion in Q2 2021 to $5.31 billion this quarter. This quarter, Adobe's quarterly revenue was once again up 10.2% year on year. Looking at the last two quarters, we can see that Adobe's revenue increased by $127 million in Q2 while it grew $134 million in Q1 CY2024. This steady quarter-on-quarter growth shows that the company can more or less maintain its growth trajectory. Next quarter's guidance suggests that Adobe is expecting revenue to grow 9.5% year on year to $5.36 billion, in line with the 10.3% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 10.7% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identifieda relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link. If you've followed StockStory for a while, you know that we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. Adobe's free cash flow came in at $1.90 billion in Q2, down 5.9% year on year. Adobe has generated $6.37 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months, an eye-popping 31.2% of revenue. This robust FCF margin stems from its asset-lite business model, scale advantages, and strong competitive positioning, giving it the option to return capital to shareholders or reinvest in its business while maintaining a healthy cash balance. It was good to see Adobe beat analysts' revenue, RPO, and EPS expectations this quarter. These beats were driven by massive outperformance in its net new Digital Media ARR, which clocked in at $487 million (vs estimates of $434 million). Thanks to the strong results, Adobe upgraded its full-year net new Digital Media ARR and EPS guidance, sending the stock price higher. We note its revenue guidance for next quarter missed Wall Street's estimates, but that didn't matter too much because the market cares most about its digital media segment. Overall, this was a great quarter. The stock is up 12.6% after reporting and currently trades at $516.49 per share. So should you invest in Adobe right now?

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/larry-ellison-fortune-grows-14-101744113.html": "Oracle's founder and largest shareholder,Larry Ellison, has jumped two spots on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index after the tech behemoth posted a bumper outlook this week. Only yesterday Ellison's net worth was $138 billion but overnight that leapt$14 billion to $152 billion. That's largely because the79-year-old entrepreneur ownsmore than 40% of the cloud applications business, which saw its shares surge 13% on June 11 after the company posted positive year-end financial results. As a result of his sudden increase in wealth Ellison jumped past two other tech titans onBloomberg's Billionaires Index: formerMicrosoft CEO Steve Ballmerand the founder ofGoogleparent company Alphabet, Sergey Brin. While Ballmer and Brin have both seen boosts to their wealth so far this year ($21.2 billion and $27.2 billion respectively) it hasn't been enough tostay ahead of Ellison, whose fortune has ballooned by $29.1 billion in 2024 alone, taking it to a record high. The reason for their collective riches growing so exponentially is Silicon Valley's favorite term: artificial intelligence. Turning first to Oracle, in its bumperoutlook released Tuesday, CEO Safra Catz said the organization had signed \"the largest sales contracts in our history\u2014driven by enormous demand for training AI large language models.\" Catz, who previously held the role of CFO at Oracle, continued: \"Throughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong AI demand to push Oracle sales\u2026 even higher. \"In Q4 alone, Oracle signed over 30 AI sales contracts totaling more than $12.5 billion\u2014including one with OpenAIto train ChatGPT in the Oracle Cloud.\" As well as the OpenAI contract, Oracle is also working more closely with Microsoft\u2014a backer of the ChatGPT maker\u2014and Google. During the earnings call, Ellison said: \"As customers continue to choose and use multiple clouds, hyperscalers likeMicrosoftand Google are responding by interconnecting their clouds. \"Oracle recently signed an agreement with Google to interconnect our clouds\u2026 We expect the Oracle database to be available within the Google Cloud in September this year.\" Others with Big Tech ties have also seen their wealth spike this year thanks to\u2014you guessed it\u2014AI. Across the board the super-rich have seenat least $150 billion added to their fortunescourtesy of the tech. Take Brin, who owns 41.8% of Alphabet's Class B stocks\u2014per the company's2023 proxy statement\u2014and CEO Sundar Pichai, who owns 227,560 Class A shares. Both individuals have seen their fortunes grow thanks to the disruptive technology, with Pichainow nearing billionaire statusthanks to his salary package and stock awards. Alphabet's stock has surged this year\u2014up 28% for the year to date at the time of writing\u2014but has bounced particularly when earnings have shared positive AI news. On April 25, in one example, the companyannounced its Q12024 resultsand said it was \"well under way withour Gemini era\" and was continuing to establish itself as an AI leader. The market liked what it heard, and sharesopened 15% higherthe day following the announcement compared to the morning prior. The story is the same for Ballmer and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. In April,Gates's wealth grew $2 billionoff the back of an earnings call which mentioned AI 50 times, as CEO Satya Nadella revealed a raft of new AI deployments. He said: \u201cWe have the most powerful AI infrastructure, and it\u2019s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well asNvidiaand leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection to train large models.\" After the call Microsoft shares logged their best single-day percentage hike since November 2022. Analysts also pointed out the shares reached a milestone on an absolute basis\u2014they had previously never risen more than $19.77 in a single session, until they did at the end of April. Elsewhere Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg's wealth has grown thanks to a combination of his \"year of efficiency\" and his adventures in artificial intelligence. In January, Zuckerberg outlined a raft of measures to streamline the company and in Februaryoutlined a wider artificial intelligence strategy\u2014since then his wealth has grown from $63 billion to $181 billion, perBloomberg's Billionaires Index.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-stock-market-rally-has-been-all-about-large-caps-080019421.html": "Large-cap stocks have been the clear leader in the 2024 stock market rally. Bespoke Investment Group recently broke the S&P 500's year-to-date performance (^GSPC)into 10 baskets of 50 stocks, organized by the size of their market capitalization value. The top decile of the 50 largest stocks in the index was the only subsector to have outperformed the broader S&P 500 this year. To Bespoke, this shows therecent trend in marketshas generally been \"the smaller the stock, the weaker the returns.\" The move into large-cap stocks comes as investorshave scaled back bets on interest rate cutsfrom the Federal Reserve this year amid sticky inflation reports. The larger stocks have shown more resilience to higher interest rates in an environment where many expect rates to be held high for longer than initially expected. That's partly because large caps have continued to post robust earnings growth. In the first quarter, research from Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha showed earnings for a basket of stocks labeled \"Mega-Cap Growth and Tech\" grew 39% compared with 5.9% year-over-year growth for the S&P 500. The megacap basket includes the\"Magnificent Seven\"tech stocks, among a few other big names like Netflix (NFLX), Visa (V), and Adobe (ADBE). This fundamental case has supported large caps when the outlook for interest rates and the trajectory for economic growthhave become less certain. Meanwhile, small caps have continued to underperform no matter how interest rates move. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Sunday night that this recent market action has him skeptical there will be a strong case for small-cap outperformance anytime soon. \"We view higher rates as a clear headwind to small caps, but we're skeptical that lower rates offer a comparable benefit \u2014 a key reason we remain overweight large caps,\" Wilson wrote. He added, \"The economy is still expanding and trailing S&P 500 earnings growth is finally reaccelerating again led by large cap, high quality stocks.\" Bigger stocks are also winning the artificial intelligence trade. Bespoke analyzed a group of AI ETFs to identify nearly 200 stocks that are frequently in indexes related to the AI trade. The team found that within those indexes, stocks with a market cap over $1 trillion have returned a combined average of 41% this year, while those with market caps under $1 trillion have gained just 0.42% year to date. Notably, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the only US stocks with market caps above $1 trillion. \"The early days of the AI boom were pretty broad, but recently it has been the mega-caps, driven primarily by NVIDIA, that has been the only game in town,\" Bespoke's team wrote in its Monday note.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-beats-microsoft-return-worlds-134833825.html": "By Sruthi Shankar (Reuters) - Apple once again became the world's most valuable company on Wednesday, dethroning Microsoft from the top spot, as the iPhone maker pushed ahead in a race to dominate artificial intelligence technology. Its shares jumped nearly 4% to a record $215.04, giving it a market valuation of $3.29 trillion. Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $3.24 trillion, falling behind Apple for the first time in five months. The stock surge comes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit a record high on fresh signs of cooling inflation. Apple shares had added more than 7% in the previous session, a day after it unveiled a range of AI-enabled features and software enhancements for its devices, a move that several analysts said would power iPhone sales. At Apple's annual developer conference on Monday, executives, including CEO Tim Cook, touted how voice assistant Siri would be able to interact with messages, emails, calendar as well as third-party apps. \"All those questions about Apple lagging from an AI technology standpoint were answered at the Worldwide Developers Conference,\" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \"Some of the specifics about AI capabilities that are going to be integrated into the upcoming iPhones made it very apparent that there will clearly be demand for a significant upgrade cycle.\" The tech giant has trailed rivals such as Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet in the red-hot field of AI, a reason why its shares underperformed this year compared to its peers. Some of the concerns over its weak share performance, however, eased after Apple beat market expectations for quarterly results and forecast in May, and unveiled a record $110 billion buyback plan. Apple's shares have risen about 12% so far in 2024, while Microsoft has added about 16% and Alphabet nearly 28%. AI chip leader Nvidia, which briefly overtook Apple's market value last week, is up a whopping 154% this year. Nvidia last had a market value of $3.11 trillion. Tesla is the only other 'Magnificent Seven' stock that has fared worse than Apple this year, with an about 30% slide.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-microsoft-corporation-nasdaq-msft-213849802.html": "We recently compiled the list of the10 Stocks That Are Upgraded by Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0stands against the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. But first, we are going to take a look at what the markets are doing. Global financial markets reacted with volatility today as the yen stumbled against the dollar, marking a significant decline after the Bank of Japan's cautious stance on reducing bond purchases. European stock futures, in contrast, showed signs of recovery following Thursday's substantial selloff, while Asian markets painted a mixed picture with losses in Australian and Chinese shares juxtaposed against gains in Korean equities. The yen experienced a notable decline against the dollar following the Bank of Japan's announcement of a delay in detailing its plans for reducing bond purchases, leading to a surge in Japanese sovereign bond futures. This move came amidst contrasting market reactions across different regions on Thursday. While European stock futures saw gains recovering from the previous day's heavy sell-off, Asian markets faced mixed fortunes: Australian and Chinese shares retreated, while Korean stocks advanced. Specifically, the yen dropped by as much as 0.6% to 157.98 against the dollar initially, although it later recovered some of its losses. This development triggered significant movements in bond markets, where benchmark 10-year bonds saw yields plummeting to 0.915% as futures surged, marking the most substantial increase since late December. The Bank of Japan's decision to delay specifics on reducing debt purchases until its next policy meeting underscored lingering uncertainties in the financial landscape. This cautious approach prompted traders to recalibrate expectations for an imminent rate hike, as reflected in reduced bets within the swaps market. In parallel, Japanese equities displayed resilience amid the broader regional downturn, with the Topix Index surging by up to 0.9%. The overall market sentiment reflected a cautious optimism tempered by the central bank's deferred actions, highlighting the nuanced responses in global financial markets amidst ongoing economic adjustments and policy recalibrations. In the current quarter, Bitcoin is facing stiff competition from traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which have outperformed the cryptocurrency amidst growing skepticism about its rebound prospects. JPMorgan strategists have raised concerns over a potential slowdown in inflows into the crypto market, highlighting broader doubts about its sustained growth. As of midday Friday in Singapore, Bitcoin has seen a decline of approximately 5% since the beginning of April, trailing behind global equity indices, fixed income benchmarks, and even commodities like gold. This underperformance underscores a shifting sentiment in financial markets, where investors appear to be favoring more established asset classes over the volatility and uncertainty associated with digital currencies. The contrast in performance between Bitcoin and traditional investments reflects a cautious stance among market participants, who are closely monitoring developments in both economic policy and regulatory environments that could further impact the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. This dynamic landscape suggests a recalibration of investment strategies amid evolving market conditions and changing perceptions of risk. Thailand\u2019s Government Pension Fund is banking on a diversified strategy centered around gold, commodities, and private equity to offset lackluster performance in domestic stocks, amid challenging market conditions in recent times. According to Songpol Chevapanyaroj, the secretary-general of the state pension fund, the portfolio is poised to deliver returns exceeding 3% for the year 2024, a notable improvement from the 1.5% achieved in 2023. This optimistic outlook reflects strategic shifts within the fund, including increased allocations to gold and commodities. These investments are positioned as hedges against inflationary pressures and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, enhancing the fund's resilience against market volatilities. The decision underscores a proactive approach by Thailand\u2019s Government Pension Fund to navigate through economic uncertainties and optimize returns in a diversified investment landscape. By diversifying into alternative assets alongside traditional holdings, the fund aims to strengthen its financial position and achieve sustainable growth amid evolving global economic dynamics. During the week leading up to Wednesday, investors shifted their focus within the U.S. equity market, favoring growth stocks while shedding value stocks, reports BofA Global Research. This movement coincided with unexpected stability in the U.S. consumer price index data for May, which contributed to a decline in bond yields and heightened expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. According to BofA, there was a significant influx of $1.8 billion into U.S. growth stock funds, contrasted by $2.6 billion in outflows from U.S. value stocks during the same period. This trend underscores a preference among investors for sectors and companies expected to thrive in a low-interest-rate environment, where growth stocks historically perform well. In addition to these equity shifts, the report highlights broader movements in financial markets. Investors allocated approximately $40 billion into cash, reflecting a cautious stance amidst market uncertainties. Concurrently, there was notable demand for U.S. Treasuries, with $1.8 billion flowing into these safe-haven assets, alongside $7.7 billion directed towards investment-grade bonds. The Federal Reserve's revised forecast of potentially one rate cut this year, down from earlier expectations of three cuts, further influenced market sentiment. This adjustment in monetary policy outlooks likely played a role in reshaping investor strategies and asset allocations throughout the week. Overall, the dynamics observed in U.S. equity flows and bond markets reflect a nuanced response to economic data and central bank signals, highlighting investors' adaptability amidst evolving financial conditions and expectations. In our original article we listed 10 companies whose price targets were raised by analysts and ranked them by their upside potential by comparing their current market price with the raised price target.

In Q1 2024, the company surpassed expectations with earnings per share (EPS) of $2.99, underscoring strong revenue growth, especially within its cloud computing segment. The robust performance of Azure and increasing demand for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI-powered solutions are key drivers fueling Tigress Financial's positive outlook on the stock. The strategic investments Microsoft continues to make in AI and cloud technologies, coupled with its strategic acquisition of Activision Blizzard, are viewed as crucial elements for future growth and market expansion. Analysts maintain a strong buy consensus for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recognizing its leadership in technological innovation and its ability to capitalize on evolving industry trends.

Microsoft continues to report strong quarterly results, with revenue growth of 16% year-over-year in constant currency thanks to better-than-expected demand in its intelligent cloud segment, which saw revenue growth of 19% year-over-year, driven by Azure growth of 28% with AI contributing 6pts to growth compared with 3pts in the prior quarter. While the adoption of GenAI remains in its early stages, Microsoft has disclosed positive initial data points with 53,000 Azure AI customers as of its December quarter up from 18,000 in the prior quarter, 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers (up 30% sequentially) and more than 230,000 organizations who have used AI capabilities in the power platform (up 80% sequentially).

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peloton-pton-shares-skyrocket-know-150205597.html": "Shares of exercise equipment company Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) jumped 6.9% in the morning session after major indices soared as yields declined after the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of May 2024 came in better than expected at 3.3% year on year (versus analysts\u2019 expectations for 3.4%). The data also revealed that inflation was flat (unchanged) month on month. The inflation results benefitted from a 2% decline in the energy index, while shelter inflation remained sticky (up 0.4% m/m and 5.4% y/y). Sticky inflation is exactly what has delayed the Fed\u2019s planned rate cuts in 2024, with some market participants likely worried that inflation might stay higher for longer. Today\u2019s report eased those worries a bit. As a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market. Is now the time to buy Peloton?Access our full analysis report here, it's free. Peloton's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 67 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 22 days ago, when the stock\u00a0dropped 12.9% on the news that the company announced a refinancing plan to improve its liquidity and shore up its balance sheet. Peloton intends to 1.) Offer $275.0 million of convertible senior notes due 2029 in a private offering 2.) Enter into a $1 billion five-year term loan facility 3.) Enter into a $100.0 million five-year revolving credit facility. The company intends to use the proceeds to repurchase $800m of existing debt and refinance existing loans. Rising interest rates have raised the borrowing cost for companies, and Peloton's debt issuance is likely being met with skepticism by investors. The market could be worried about the cost of managing the debt, including interest payment, given its weak topline growth and unstable business that has recently seen the CEO depart. Also, the company has struggled to generate positive cash flows following the pandemic-era boom in demand, which was a huge tailwind to the business but proved temporary. Finally, there could also be concerns about the potential dilutive effect of the convertible notes, which can be converted to the company's common stock, raising the total share count. Peloton is down 34.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $3.83 per share it is trading 60.9% below its 52-week high of $9.78 from July 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Peloton's shares at the IPO in September 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $148.56. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracles-cloud-efforts-receive-much-183828385.html": "On Tuesday, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) posted its\u00a0fiscal fourth-quarter earnings\u00a0that were below estimates.\u00a0But, known for its database software, Oracle went all in to expand its cloud infrastructure unit to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison also noted that\u00a0Oracle's cloud infrastructure and data centers are also being used by Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and xAI, an AI company founded by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk. For the quarter ended on May 31st, total revenue grew 3.3% to $14.29 billion, which was below LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$14.55 billion.\u00a0Cloud infrastructure alone brought in $2 billion, as renting of computing power and storage increased 42%. Although it remains much smaller compared to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service, Oracle\u2019s cloud unit is growing faster.\u00a0The cloud services and license support segment grew 9%, generating revenue of $10.23 billion. Cloud and on-premises licenses business contracted 15% as it brought in revenue of $1.84 billion. Adjusted profit was $1.63 per share, also short of LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$1.65.\u00a0Net income amounted to $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share. Partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud show undeniable cloud momentum The aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to\u00a0extend Azure Al to\u00a0Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\u00a0(OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl.\u00a0Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure.\u00a0As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges.\u00a0Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle\u2019s cloud database growth. For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%. Oracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024. For the current fiscal year ending in May 2025,\u00a0Catz\u00a0expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads,\u00a0adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand. Shifting focus away from weak Q4 financials. Meanwhile,\u00a0Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st.\u00a0Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies\u00a0analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won\u2019t last forever.

One of the most well-known Silicon Valley software companies around, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a leading provider of software as service in the digital design and document management space. The demand for rich, interactive 2D, 3D, VR and AR experiences is growing, and while the ubiquitous metaverse might still be more of a buzzword than a real thing, what is real is the demand for the tools to create these experiences, whether they are games, 3D tours or interactive movies. As you can see below, Adobe's revenue growth has been unremarkable over the last three years, growing from $3.84 billion in Q2 2021 to $5.31 billion this quarter. This quarter, Adobe's quarterly revenue was once again up 10.2% year on year. Looking at the last two quarters, we can see that Adobe's revenue increased by $127 million in Q2 while it grew $134 million in Q1 CY2024. This steady quarter-on-quarter growth shows that the company can more or less maintain its growth trajectory. Next quarter's guidance suggests that Adobe is expecting revenue to grow 9.5% year on year to $5.36 billion, in line with the 10.3% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 10.7% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

If you've followed StockStory for a while, you know that we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. Adobe's free cash flow came in at $1.90 billion in Q2, down 5.9% year on year. Adobe has generated $6.37 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months, an eye-popping 31.2% of revenue. This robust FCF margin stems from its asset-lite business model, scale advantages, and strong competitive positioning, giving it the option to return capital to shareholders or reinvest in its business while maintaining a healthy cash balance. It was good to see Adobe beat analysts' revenue, RPO, and EPS expectations this quarter. These beats were driven by massive outperformance in its net new Digital Media ARR, which clocked in at $487 million (vs estimates of $434 million). Thanks to the strong results, Adobe upgraded its full-year net new Digital Media ARR and EPS guidance, sending the stock price higher. We note its revenue guidance for next quarter missed Wall Street's estimates, but that didn't matter too much because the market cares most about its digital media segment. Overall, this was a great quarter. The stock is up 12.6% after reporting and currently trades at $516.49 per share. So should you invest in Adobe right now?

But Englander likes to be in control. \u00a0A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm. The report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is \u201cnot a good idea.\u201d The FT report said Englander\u2019s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,\u00a0 13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020. For this article, we scanned Millennium Management\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). Israel Englander of Millennium Management Billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s Stake Value:$1,779,205,187 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter. However, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) skeptics believe the stock has run too much as its valuation is high. For value-conscious investors the market is indeed teeming with other opportunities. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced MSFT to take the spot of the most popular stock among the over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. A total of 302 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in itsfirst quarter 2024 investor letter: \u201cAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack \u2013 infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).\u201d Overall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list of Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. You can visitBillionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024to see other stocks in the list.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/business-world-ties-elevate-key-contenders-in-trumps-search-for-a-running-mate-133019277.html": "Donald Trump is narrowing his running mate choices, and the business world ties of some top candidates are helping them rise on his list. It also helps that they are aiding Trump's own search for new deep-pocketed donors. The two leading examples of this dynamic are Ohio Senator J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Both (like Trump) have spent more of their careers in the private sector than in politics. And both have seen their chances improve as they've provided a bridge between the Trump operation and, respectively, Silicon Valley and the energy industry. The private sector experience also appears to be an advantage on its own in the eyes of Trump, who has long gravitated to CEOs. \"He probably knows more about energy than anybody I know,\" Trump said of Burgum during a recent rally in New Jersey, adding cryptically, \"so get ready for something.\" Also notable: Both Vance and Burgum have been able to overcome past criticism of Trump to gain entry into his orbit this year. Variousrecentveepstakes tallieshave consistently put the two men near the top of the list. Other oft-mentioned candidates include figures like Sens. Marco Rubio and Tim Scott, who have less direct business world experience and entered politics earlier in their careers. Of course, Trump being Trump, the list of contenders could change quickly, and the former president has a full month to make his pick after saying he wants to wait to announce until the Republican convention, which begins on July 15 in Milwaukee. In aFox News interview Thursday,Trump continued to tease the process. He reiterated that he would probably announce during the convention and that, while he isn't saying, \"I have sort of a pretty good idea\" of who it will be. Back in February,Trump saidof his VP search: \"I want people with common sense because there are so many things happening in this country that don\u2019t make sense.\" Representatives Vance and Burgum didn't respond to requests for comment. Vance is currently Ohio's junior senator and is most known for authoring the memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\" before being elected to the Senate in 2022. What he talks much less about \u2014 it'sfully omitted from his official Senate biography\u2014 is his time living in San Francisco and working as a venture capitalist for Peter Thiel at Mithril Capital. But that experience has proven to be a crucial leg up during the veepstakes. Vance recently leveraged his contacts \u2014 especially one with billionaire investor David O. Sacks \u2014 to help orchestrate a Silicon Valley fundraiser for Trump that made inroads in the deep blue area andraised a reported $12 millionfor Trump's campaign. \"These are some of the leading innovators in AI who are in that room,\" Vance saidduring a follow-up appearance on Fox Newsafter the fundraiser. Vance also confirmed during that conversation that he is being vetted by the Trump campaign, noting, \"I'm very interested in helping [Trump] out whatever that looks like.\" The story is similar for Burgum, the little-known governor of the 47th most populous state in the country who has nevertheless emerged as a top contender. He grew close to Trump after his short-lived presidential campaign ended, with Burgum quickly endorsing and going all in for Trump. But the business connections he brought to the table appear equally important. Burgum is, according to Forbes,worth more than $100 millionafter heled a North Dakota software companyin the 1980s and 1990s to an IPO and then an acquisition by Microsoft (MSFT) in 2001. He remained at Microsoft as a senior vice president through 2007 before a stint as a venture capitalist. Then he made the jump into politics and first won North Dakota's gubernatorial election in 2016. Burgum has forged close ties with the energy industry during his time atop North Dakota's government and helped deepen connections between Trump's campaign and figures like Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, who has led a series of oil officials to give to Trump. Hamm himself has given a flurry of money to Trump-aligned organizations, including a $614,000 check in March to the former president's \"Trump 47\" joint fundraising committee, according to federal election records It was also Burgum who reportedly orchestrated a controversial recent fundraiser where Trump,according to the Washington Post, told oil executives they should raise $1 billion for his campaign because Trump would reverse dozens of Biden's environmental policies. In his ownFox News appearance in recent days, Burgum fielded questions on his VP chances and engaged in a little flattery by saying that Trump works harder than the former tech CEO he used to spend time with. Beyond Vance and Burgum, another business-aligned candidate has recently emerged as a somewhat surprise contender: Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty. He had a long career in private equity before becoming Trump's ambassador to Japan and winning election to the Senate in 2020. Hagerty has populatedhis social media feedwith campaign appearances, and a recent New York Times update on the running mate racelisted him in the second tier of contenders(Burgum and Vance were in the top tier). Trump's team has long downplayed the veracity of the various public vice presidential lists. Trump campaign senior advisor Brian Hughes said in response to queries for this story, as he has often said through the process, that \"anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will pick a vice president is lying, unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\" Other candidates often mentioned in the vice presidential race are figures like Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, and Reps. Byron Donalds and Elise Stefanik. One business world candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy, has fallen off the list in recent weeks. Trump is considering the Roivant Sciences founder \u2014 and former Trump 2024 rival \u2014 potentiallyfor other rolesif he wins. Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-stock-market-rally-has-been-all-about-large-caps-080019421.html": "Large-cap stocks have been the clear leader in the 2024 stock market rally. Bespoke Investment Group recently broke the S&P 500's year-to-date performance (^GSPC)into 10 baskets of 50 stocks, organized by the size of their market capitalization value. The top decile of the 50 largest stocks in the index was the only subsector to have outperformed the broader S&P 500 this year. To Bespoke, this shows therecent trend in marketshas generally been \"the smaller the stock, the weaker the returns.\" The move into large-cap stocks comes as investorshave scaled back bets on interest rate cutsfrom the Federal Reserve this year amid sticky inflation reports. The larger stocks have shown more resilience to higher interest rates in an environment where many expect rates to be held high for longer than initially expected. That's partly because large caps have continued to post robust earnings growth. In the first quarter, research from Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha showed earnings for a basket of stocks labeled \"Mega-Cap Growth and Tech\" grew 39% compared with 5.9% year-over-year growth for the S&P 500. The megacap basket includes the\"Magnificent Seven\"tech stocks, among a few other big names like Netflix (NFLX), Visa (V), and Adobe (ADBE). This fundamental case has supported large caps when the outlook for interest rates and the trajectory for economic growthhave become less certain. Meanwhile, small caps have continued to underperform no matter how interest rates move. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Sunday night that this recent market action has him skeptical there will be a strong case for small-cap outperformance anytime soon. \"We view higher rates as a clear headwind to small caps, but we're skeptical that lower rates offer a comparable benefit \u2014 a key reason we remain overweight large caps,\" Wilson wrote. He added, \"The economy is still expanding and trailing S&P 500 earnings growth is finally reaccelerating again led by large cap, high quality stocks.\" Bigger stocks are also winning the artificial intelligence trade. Bespoke analyzed a group of AI ETFs to identify nearly 200 stocks that are frequently in indexes related to the AI trade. The team found that within those indexes, stocks with a market cap over $1 trillion have returned a combined average of 41% this year, while those with market caps under $1 trillion have gained just 0.42% year to date. Notably, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the only US stocks with market caps above $1 trillion. \"The early days of the AI boom were pretty broad, but recently it has been the mega-caps, driven primarily by NVIDIA, that has been the only game in town,\" Bespoke's team wrote in its Monday note.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-netflix-inc-nasdaq-nflx-200439972.html": "We recently compiled the list of theWall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. But first, we are going to take a look at what the markets are doing. Global financial markets reacted with volatility today as the yen stumbled against the dollar, marking a significant decline after the Bank of Japan's cautious stance on reducing bond purchases. European stock futures, in contrast, showed signs of recovery following Thursday's substantial selloff, while Asian markets painted a mixed picture with losses in Australian and Chinese shares juxtaposed against gains in Korean equities. The yen experienced a notable decline against the dollar following the Bank of Japan's announcement of a delay in detailing its plans for reducing bond purchases, leading to a surge in Japanese sovereign bond futures. This move came amidst contrasting market reactions across different regions on Thursday. While European stock futures saw gains recovering from the previous day's heavy sell-off, Asian markets faced mixed fortunes: Australian and Chinese shares retreated, while Korean stocks advanced. Specifically, the yen dropped by as much as 0.6% to 157.98 against the dollar initially, although it later recovered some of its losses. This development triggered significant movements in bond markets, where benchmark 10-year bonds saw yields plummeting to 0.915% as futures surged, marking the most substantial increase since late December. The Bank of Japan's decision to delay specifics on reducing debt purchases until its next policy meeting underscored lingering uncertainties in the financial landscape. This cautious approach prompted traders to recalibrate expectations for an imminent rate hike, as reflected in reduced bets within the swaps market. In parallel, Japanese equities displayed resilience amid the broader regional downturn, with the Topix Index surging by up to 0.9%. The overall market sentiment reflected a cautious optimism tempered by the central bank's deferred actions, highlighting the nuanced responses in global financial markets amidst ongoing economic adjustments and policy recalibrations. In the current quarter, Bitcoin is facing stiff competition from traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which have outperformed the cryptocurrency amidst growing skepticism about its rebound prospects. JPMorgan strategists have raised concerns over a potential slowdown in inflows into the crypto market, highlighting broader doubts about its sustained growth. As of midday Friday in Singapore, Bitcoin has seen a decline of approximately 5% since the beginning of April, trailing behind global equity indices, fixed income benchmarks, and even commodities like gold. This underperformance underscores a shifting sentiment in financial markets, where investors appear to be favoring more established asset classes over the volatility and uncertainty associated with digital currencies. The contrast in performance between Bitcoin and traditional investments reflects a cautious stance among market participants, who are closely monitoring developments in both economic policy and regulatory environments that could further impact the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. This dynamic landscape suggests a recalibration of investment strategies amid evolving market conditions and changing perceptions of risk. Thailand\u2019s Government Pension Fund is banking on a diversified strategy centered around gold, commodities, and private equity to offset lackluster performance in domestic stocks, amid challenging market conditions in recent times. According to Songpol Chevapanyaroj, the secretary-general of the state pension fund, the portfolio is poised to deliver returns exceeding 3% for the year 2024, a notable improvement from the 1.5% achieved in 2023. This optimistic outlook reflects strategic shifts within the fund, including increased allocations to gold and commodities. These investments are positioned as hedges against inflationary pressures and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, enhancing the fund's resilience against market volatilities. The decision underscores a proactive approach by Thailand\u2019s Government Pension Fund to navigate through economic uncertainties and optimize returns in a diversified investment landscape. By diversifying into alternative assets alongside traditional holdings, the fund aims to strengthen its financial position and achieve sustainable growth amid evolving global economic dynamics. During the week leading up to Wednesday, investors shifted their focus within the U.S. equity market, favoring growth stocks while shedding value stocks, reports BofA Global Research. This movement coincided with unexpected stability in the U.S. consumer price index data for May, which contributed to a decline in bond yields and heightened expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. According to BofA, there was a significant influx of $1.8 billion into U.S. growth stock funds, contrasted by $2.6 billion in outflows from U.S. value stocks during the same period. This trend underscores a preference among investors for sectors and companies expected to thrive in a low-interest-rate environment, where growth stocks historically perform well. In addition to these equity shifts, the report highlights broader movements in financial markets. Investors allocated approximately $40 billion into cash, reflecting a cautious stance amidst market uncertainties. Concurrently, there was notable demand for U.S. Treasuries, with $1.8 billion flowing into these safe-haven assets, alongside $7.7 billion directed towards investment-grade bonds. The Federal Reserve's revised forecast of potentially one rate cut this year, down from earlier expectations of three cuts, further influenced market sentiment. This adjustment in monetary policy outlooks likely played a role in reshaping investor strategies and asset allocations throughout the week. Overall, the dynamics observed in U.S. equity flows and bond markets reflect a nuanced response to economic data and central bank signals, highlighting investors' adaptability amidst evolving financial conditions and expectations. In this article we listed 10 companies whose price targets were raised by analysts and ranked them by their upside potential by comparing their current market price with the raised price target. Upside Potential: 8% On June 13, KeyBanc revised its price target for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), a prominent player in the streaming industry, raising it by $2 to $707 from the previous $705. This adjustment reflects an upward potential of approximately 8% from the current levels. Analyst Justin Patterson highlighted Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) strong performance in Q4 2023, where despite missing some estimates, the company demonstrated significant growth. Key factors influencing the revised target include Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) successful execution of paid-sharing and ad product cycles, as well as strategic initiatives such as price increases and efforts in ad monetization. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported notable Q4 2023 results, with earnings per share (EPS) reaching $2.11 and revenue totaling $8.83 billion, marking a 12.5% increase year-over-year. Looking forward to Q1 2024, while the company expects a slight moderation in subscriber additions, it anticipates continued revenue growth driven by higher average revenue per membership (ARM) and further expansion of its ads business. This strategic focus underscores KeyBanc's confidence in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) ability to capitalize on evolving market opportunities and maintain its growth trajectory, supporting the rationale behind the revised price target. RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated thefollowingregarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: \u201cNetflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX): NFLX was a top contributor in 1Q24 following strong fourth quarter earnings and 2024 guidance driven by better-than-expected subscriber adds (+13.1 million versus estimates of +8.9 million). The company\u2019s subscriber growth continued to accelerate following the company\u2019s crack down on password sharing and the rollout of the lower cost, advertising supported subscriber offering known as the Ad Tier. ARPU came in below expectations, but recently announced price increases in the US, UK and France showed signs of moving ARPU higher. NFLX guided 2024 operating margins to 24%, ahead of prior guidance of 22-23%, and guided to 2024 free cash flow of $6 billion. The recent re-acceleration of subscriber growth, plus price increases on premium memberships and a stabilization of content investments, should position the company for low double digit annual revenue growth over the next few years while driving improved operating margin to more than 25%. We also believe that the stabilization of content spend should allow the company to continue to scale its FCF.\u201d Overall, NFLX ranks 10th among the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. You can visitWall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targetsto see the other stocks whose price targets analysts recently raised. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracles-cloud-efforts-receive-much-183828385.html": "On Tuesday, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) posted its\u00a0fiscal fourth-quarter earnings\u00a0that were below estimates.\u00a0But, known for its database software, Oracle went all in to expand its cloud infrastructure unit to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison also noted that\u00a0Oracle's cloud infrastructure and data centers are also being used by Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and xAI, an AI company founded by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk. For the quarter ended on May 31st, total revenue grew 3.3% to $14.29 billion, which was below LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$14.55 billion.\u00a0Cloud infrastructure alone brought in $2 billion, as renting of computing power and storage increased 42%. Although it remains much smaller compared to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service, Oracle\u2019s cloud unit is growing faster.\u00a0The cloud services and license support segment grew 9%, generating revenue of $10.23 billion. Cloud and on-premises licenses business contracted 15% as it brought in revenue of $1.84 billion. Adjusted profit was $1.63 per share, also short of LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$1.65.\u00a0Net income amounted to $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share. Partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud show undeniable cloud momentum The aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to\u00a0extend Azure Al to\u00a0Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\u00a0(OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl.\u00a0Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure.\u00a0As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges.\u00a0Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle\u2019s cloud database growth. For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%. Oracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024. For the current fiscal year ending in May 2025,\u00a0Catz\u00a0expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads,\u00a0adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand. Shifting focus away from weak Q4 financials. Meanwhile,\u00a0Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st.\u00a0Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies\u00a0analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won\u2019t last forever.

BillionaireIsrael Englanderis one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund\u2019s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg\u2019s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander\u2019s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium\u2019s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander\u2019s imposition of \u201ctight guardrails\u201d to limit losses. \u00a0To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control. \u00a0A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm. The report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is \u201cnot a good idea.\u201d The FT report said Englander\u2019s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,\u00a0 13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020. For this article, we scanned Millennium Management\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). Israel Englander of Millennium Management Billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s Stake Value:$1,779,205,187 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter. However, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) skeptics believe the stock has run too much as its valuation is high. For value-conscious investors the market is indeed teeming with other opportunities. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced MSFT to take the spot of the most popular stock among the over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. A total of 302 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in itsfirst quarter 2024 investor letter: \u201cAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack \u2013 infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).\u201d Overall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list of Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. You can visitBillionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024to see other stocks in the list.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-is-winning-over-investors-but-its-growth-story-relies-on-three-key-e-commerce-initiatives-211101127.html": "Walmart (WMT) is winning over Wall Street, but the shopping giant will need results from its e-commerce business to maintain its position as a retail darling. \"E-commerce sales surpassed $100 billion dollars globally\" last year, CEO Doug McMillon said at the company's annual associates meeting last week. \"We're now in a position to grow sales because we can serve customers and members how they want to be served, to grow profit faster than sales, while delivering low prices and investing in you at the same time,\" he added. The company plans to use artificial intelligence, advertising, and its giant collection of stores to turn its long-running e-commerce business profitable in the next year or two, its executives told Yahoo Finance. Walmart shares are up 26% this year, roughly double that of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain. The stock, trading near record highs, strikes \"a strong balance of defense and offense on both the top and bottom lines\" in a softening consumer backdrop, JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said in a client note. With a looming election and reduced expectations of Fed rate cuts, Walmart's consistent performance may become increasingly appealing amid the volatility. In recent years, the retailer has benefitted from shoppers looking for cheaper groceries, which make up 60% of its US sales. But the e-commerce landscape is not getting any easier, with Amazon (AMZN) still leading the race and rivals like Target (TGT) ramping up their efforts. After explosive growth during pandemic shutdowns and a subsequent slowdown, Walmart is making gains again online. Last quarter, the company's US e-commerce sales jumped 22%, led by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery and its online marketplace. Amazon's secret sauce has long been its extensive investments in AI and machine learning, allowing it to make accurate product recommendations and gain insights into shoppers' patterns. Its ability to predict demand \u2014 say, Seattle customers like to buy umbrellas in March \u2014 allows it to dispatch inventory to the right warehouses, enabling its vaunted two-day delivery system. Walmart CTO Suresh Kumar said the company is also investing in generative AI and machine learning. Earlier this year, itannouncedplans to use GenAI to add personalized search, a popular feature on Amazon. For example, if you search for \"birthday party,\" a slew of items like candles, decorations, and cards show up. Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group says Walmart has taken a leap forward in terms of applying data to its operations and harnessing valuable insights. It's using data to optimize its supply chain operations, creating efficient routes for transportation and distribution and making sure it delivers the right products on time, per Feldman. Kumar, a former Amazon executive, said \"Walmart is in the best position\" when it comes to training models due to the vast amount of data it collects online and in-store. \"What we've learned in the US and in other markets that we operate in is that omni actually is the preferred offer for customers. They like being able to go to a physical [store] and interact with people, and they want the convenience of e-commerce,\" CEO McMillon told Yahoo Finance. Around 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of one of Walmart's 4,700 stores, a leg up compared to Target (1,963 stores) and Costco (605). Its extensive footprint allows it to offer speedy delivery directly from the stores. For items in stock, shoppers can get express one-hour delivery for $10, while three-hour delivery will cost $5. Over the past year, Walmart delivered 4.4 billion items with same-day or next-day delivery, 20% of which were delivered in less than three hours, according to its US CEO John Furner. Expanding itsWalmart+membership will be key to serving consumers' preference to shop both online and in-store, per Kumar. The membership model, which launched in 2020, includes benefits like free same-day grocery delivery from store ($35 order minimum), free shipping on general merchandise from Walmart, and savings on fuel. Having a physical network that enables fast delivery can be particularly advantageous for the online grocery business, Horvers pointed out. Feldman said Walmart+ has \"relatively low penetration\" so far, but the adoption rate has \"increased significantly in the past year.\" While it remains to be seen how the members behave differently, paid members typically shop more, like at Costco and Walmart's Sam's Club (where the US e-commerce business is profitable). But the company's biggest obstacle in e-commerce remains overall awareness. \"It's getting people to not think of Amazon first. It's getting people to think Walmart first,\" said Feldman. Last quarter, sales from its US retail media business, Walmart Connect, jumped 26%. Its biggest product is paid search, which allows companies to pay for sponsored ads placed above the search results, according to Walmart Connect's SVP of sales Ryan Mayward. The platform also offers other ads (think banners in product pages), offsite ads (like on TikTok and Disney+), and in-store ads, which got a boost as part of the company's$9 billion store makeovers. It has improved client access, building a self-service model that allows advertisers to check the marketing performance themselves instead of relying on reports from Walmart. Mayward touted Walmart's scale as an edge for attracting third-party sellers to its online marketplace. Then, as more customers shop on its marketplace, it becomes more important for sellers to use advertising to stand out from the competition. In February, Walmart announced plans to acquire connected TV maker Vizio for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share. The move is expected to accelerate growth for its ad business. \"[Advertising] is a fast-growing high-margin part of our business,\"Walmart CFO John David Rainey told Yahoo Financefollowing the announcement. \"And what this deal with Vizio does \u2014 it\u2019s very complementary to what we\u2019re doing organically.\" But the company has a long way to go to compete with Amazon, which brought in $47 billion in advertising revenue in 2023, compared to Walmart's $3.4 billion. \"I expect Walmart\u2019s ad business to continue growing from here, but I don\u2019t expect it to rival the size of Amazon\u2019s ad business anytime soon,\" Morningstar analyst Noah Rohr told Yahoo Finance. He added that while Walmart's e-commerce business still lags far behind Amazon's, \"Walmart is better positioned here than most competing brick-and-mortar retailers.\" \u2014 Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-stock-market-rally-has-been-all-about-large-caps-080019421.html": "Large-cap stocks have been the clear leader in the 2024 stock market rally. Bespoke Investment Group recently broke the S&P 500's year-to-date performance (^GSPC)into 10 baskets of 50 stocks, organized by the size of their market capitalization value. The top decile of the 50 largest stocks in the index was the only subsector to have outperformed the broader S&P 500 this year. To Bespoke, this shows therecent trend in marketshas generally been \"the smaller the stock, the weaker the returns.\" The move into large-cap stocks comes as investorshave scaled back bets on interest rate cutsfrom the Federal Reserve this year amid sticky inflation reports. The larger stocks have shown more resilience to higher interest rates in an environment where many expect rates to be held high for longer than initially expected. That's partly because large caps have continued to post robust earnings growth. In the first quarter, research from Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha showed earnings for a basket of stocks labeled \"Mega-Cap Growth and Tech\" grew 39% compared with 5.9% year-over-year growth for the S&P 500. The megacap basket includes the\"Magnificent Seven\"tech stocks, among a few other big names like Netflix (NFLX), Visa (V), and Adobe (ADBE). This fundamental case has supported large caps when the outlook for interest rates and the trajectory for economic growthhave become less certain. Meanwhile, small caps have continued to underperform no matter how interest rates move. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Sunday night that this recent market action has him skeptical there will be a strong case for small-cap outperformance anytime soon. \"We view higher rates as a clear headwind to small caps, but we're skeptical that lower rates offer a comparable benefit \u2014 a key reason we remain overweight large caps,\" Wilson wrote. He added, \"The economy is still expanding and trailing S&P 500 earnings growth is finally reaccelerating again led by large cap, high quality stocks.\" Bigger stocks are also winning the artificial intelligence trade. Bespoke analyzed a group of AI ETFs to identify nearly 200 stocks that are frequently in indexes related to the AI trade. The team found that within those indexes, stocks with a market cap over $1 trillion have returned a combined average of 41% this year, while those with market caps under $1 trillion have gained just 0.42% year to date. Notably, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the only US stocks with market caps above $1 trillion. \"The early days of the AI boom were pretty broad, but recently it has been the mega-caps, driven primarily by NVIDIA, that has been the only game in town,\" Bespoke's team wrote in its Monday note.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adobe-inc-nasdaq-adbe-downgraded-171118404.html": "We recently compiled the list of theAnalysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u00a0stands against the other stocks that received a downgrade from Wall Street analysts. But first, we are going to take a look at what the markets are doing. Amidst the anticipation surrounding pivotal economic indicators, European futures are on the ascent, signaling a cautious optimism among traders as they prepare for the release of crucial US inflation figures and the Federal Reserve's forthcoming monetary-policy decision. While Asian equities faced a downturn, European stock futures, particularly contracts on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, exhibited a marginal uptick of 0.2%. Concurrently, treasuries in Asia recorded marginal gains, while Bloomberg's dollar index extended its streak of consecutive advancements. With Wednesday's release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and the Fed's policy announcement looming, analysts remain vigilant, mindful of the potential resurgence in market volatility. Despite the backdrop of market uncertainty, Japanese financial institutions continue to command attention from investors, buoyed by their steadfast growth trajectory over the past year. Portfolio manager Junichi Inoue of Janus Henderson Investors underscores the undervalued status of these firms, attributing their appeal to the upward trend in dividend payments. Inoue strategically augmented exposure to Japanese financial entities, which now represent approximately 18.05% of his portfolio. Noteworthy investments include Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. and Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. The Janus Henderson Japan Opportunities Fund, under Inoue's stewardship, has notably surpassed the MSCI Japan Index, delivering a commendable 15% return this year. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, the property market slump persists, deepening with each passing day and marking a sustained downturn reminiscent of the SARS crisis two decades ago.BloombergIntelligence data reveals that real estate values, encompassing both residential and commercial sectors, have collectively plummeted by at least HK$2.1 trillion ($270 billion) since 2019. Projections from UBS Group AG and CBRE Group Inc. forewarn of further declines, underscoring the formidable challenges confronting Hong Kong's real estate sector amidst enduring uncertainty. Market analysts are viewing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to retain Nirmala Sitharaman as the country's finance minister as a positive indicator of policy consistency, according to reports from Goldman Sachs and Barclays. The reappointment of Sitharaman, alongside the return of other familiar figures from Modi's previous administration, is interpreted as a signal of continuity in government policies. Sitharaman's reappointment comes at a crucial juncture, as she faces the task of navigating fiscal demands within a coalition government framework, following the Bharatiya Janata Party's inability to secure a majority in the elections. Goldman emphasizes the potential benefits of maintaining unchanged ministry positions, suggesting that this continuity could bolster efforts towards implementing reforms. Similarly, Barclays highlights the importance of maintaining focus on infrastructure development and fiscal consolidation, expecting these initiatives to remain central to the government's agenda under Sitharaman's leadership. Oil prices dipped on Tuesday as cautious investors awaited key U.S. and China Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, alongside the Federal Reserve's policy meeting outcome. According toReuters, brent crude futures slipped by 13 cents to $81.50 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures edged down by 7 cents to $77.67 per barrel. Monday saw a brief uptick in prices, spurred by optimism surrounding increased fuel demand during the Northern Hemisphere summer vacation season, but analysts warned that this surge might be short-lived, particularly with the looming possibility of higher interest rates. Market strategist Yeap Jun Rong from IG noted that sustained recovery in oil prices may require more conviction, especially with the broader trend leaning towards downside movement since April. Traders remained on edge ahead of China's macroeconomic data release, particularly concerning inflation figures. OANDA senior market analyst Kelvin Wong highlighted the potential impact of China's Producer Price Index (PPI) data on oil prices, expressing concerns over a further slowdown in deflationary trends and its implications for oil demand. Additionally, ongoing Saudi crude exports to China and higher refinery margins provided some support to oil prices. Analysts also pointed to the possibility of the United States increasing crude purchases for its petroleum reserve, particularly if WTI stays below $79 per barrel. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm indicated plans to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, targeting purchases at around $79 per barrel, as maintenance on the stockpile is scheduled for completion by year-end. In this article we listed 10 companies that were downgraded by analysts and ranked them by the change in their market prices. Negative changes signal that the market participants agree with the analysts\u2019 assessment. Charts on the paper Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -5.49(-1.18%) On June 10, Melius Research made a notable adjustment to its evaluation of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), downgrading the company from a previous recommendation to a \"Hold\" rating. This decision was influenced by the challenges Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) faces within the competitive landscape of the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The downgrade reflects growing concerns regarding Adobe Inc.'s ability to effectively compete and innovate in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, which is becoming increasingly critical across various industries. While Adobe Inc. has made strides in integrating AI into its product suite, introducing features like the Adobe Acrobat AI Assistant and other generative AI tools aimed at improving document comprehension and productivity, Melius Research highlights the formidable competitive pressures and the imperative for continual innovation in AI. Despite Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) established strength in digital media and marketing software, Melius Research advises investors to proceed with caution, citing uncertainties surrounding Adobe Inc.'s trajectory in AI and the necessity for vigilant monitoring. This shift in rating occurs as Adobe Inc. persists in introducing new AI-driven features, striving to maintain its foothold in the market. However, Melius Research's assessment underscores the pivotal role that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) strategies and execution in the AI domain will play in shaping its future performance. The downgrade by Melius Research elicited a market reaction, with Adobe Inc.'s stock price experiencing a decline of 1.18% on June 10, closing at $459.94. This adjustment underscores the significance of Adobe Inc.'s endeavors in AI and the heightened scrutiny surrounding its competitiveness and innovation efforts in this critical area. Baron Durable Advantage Fund stated thefollowingregarding Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: \u201cAdobe Inc.(NASDAQ:ADBE) is a leading developer of marketing, publishing, and graphics software. Shares declined 15.6% during the quarter after the company reported annual recurring revenue that surpassed its initial guidance but fell short of buy-side expectations by $20 million to $25 million. This shortfall raised investor concerns that Adobe may need a faster ramp in the second half of the fiscal year to hit its annual guidance. We have conviction that Adobe can meet or exceed its guidance thanks to: 1) expansion of price increases to additional regions as well as heightened renewals in the second half of the year, and easier year-over-year comparisons due to the dissipation of headwinds from 2022\u2019s price increases; 2) incremental monetization from GenAI\u2019s new offerings, particularly within enterprise-focused solutions like GenStudio and Firefly, which are gaining traction; and 3) introducing new solutions, including upcoming Document Intelligence add-on capabilities. While investors remain focused on the short term, we believe Adobe is a leading creative and marketing franchise with an exciting innovation cycle ahead, poised to optimize its extensive user base, expand its opportunity, and benefit from GenAI trends. We believe the stock\u2019s decline is overdone as more than 100% of the decline was driven by multiple contraction, even though the company\u2019s 2024 EPS estimates increased slightly (by 0.3% during the quarter) and the company\u2019s intrinsic value has not materially changed.\u201d Overall, ADBE ranks 5th among the stocks recently downgraded by Wall Street analysts. You can visitAnalysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocksto see the other stocks that reacted to analyst downgrades. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

On the other hand, the company expects next quarter's revenue to be around $5.36 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates.

One of the most well-known Silicon Valley software companies around, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a leading provider of software as service in the digital design and document management space. The demand for rich, interactive 2D, 3D, VR and AR experiences is growing, and while the ubiquitous metaverse might still be more of a buzzword than a real thing, what is real is the demand for the tools to create these experiences, whether they are games, 3D tours or interactive movies. As you can see below, Adobe's revenue growth has been unremarkable over the last three years, growing from $3.84 billion in Q2 2021 to $5.31 billion this quarter. This quarter, Adobe's quarterly revenue was once again up 10.2% year on year. Looking at the last two quarters, we can see that Adobe's revenue increased by $127 million in Q2 while it grew $134 million in Q1 CY2024. This steady quarter-on-quarter growth shows that the company can more or less maintain its growth trajectory. Next quarter's guidance suggests that Adobe is expecting revenue to grow 9.5% year on year to $5.36 billion, in line with the 10.3% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 10.7% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identifieda relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link. If you've followed StockStory for a while, you know that we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. Adobe's free cash flow came in at $1.90 billion in Q2, down 5.9% year on year. Adobe has generated $6.37 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months, an eye-popping 31.2% of revenue. This robust FCF margin stems from its asset-lite business model, scale advantages, and strong competitive positioning, giving it the option to return capital to shareholders or reinvest in its business while maintaining a healthy cash balance. It was good to see Adobe beat analysts' revenue, RPO, and EPS expectations this quarter. These beats were driven by massive outperformance in its net new Digital Media ARR, which clocked in at $487 million (vs estimates of $434 million). Thanks to the strong results, Adobe upgraded its full-year net new Digital Media ARR and EPS guidance, sending the stock price higher. We note its revenue guidance for next quarter missed Wall Street's estimates, but that didn't matter too much because the market cares most about its digital media segment. Overall, this was a great quarter. The stock is up 12.6% after reporting and currently trades at $516.49 per share. So should you invest in Adobe right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.

The Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market\u2019s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI. \u00a0SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank\u2019s CFO, who said the bank\u2019s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a \u201cbreak from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.\u201d In this backdrop it\u2019s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what\u2019s happening in the AI space. In this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can\u2019t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here). Copyright:photogearch / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 108 Adobe shares are rising on Friday after the company crushed past analyst estimates for Q2, putting an end to skeptics' narrative which said the company's editing tools were under threat from the generative AI revolution. JPMorgan upgraded the stock to Overweight from Neutral after the Q2 results and upped its price target to $580 from $570. Previously, the stock suffered as several analysts voiced their doubts around Adobe's growth in the AI era. Melius Research recently downgraded Adobe Inc (NYSE:ADBE) stock to Hold from Buy with a $510 price target, citing broader issues the enterprise software industry is experiencing when it comes to AI. Melius analyst Ben Reitzes said these issues are similar to the ones on-premise hardware companies experienced following the rise of Cloud computing. The analyst also said that AI is making it easier for smaller companies to develop and deploy tools, increasing competition to bigger players in the industry. Adobe Inc (NYSE:ADBE) shares have lost about 20% so far this year. The notion that the rise of generative AI tools would give a tough competition to Adobe Inc\u2019s (NYSE:ADBE) design tools is weighing down the stock.

Creative Cloud remains the solution of choice for the world\u2019s creators, whether their medium is design, photography, video, illustration or 3D. Adobe Express is inspiring millions of users of all skill levels to design more quickly and easily than ever before.

Some investors seem to believe that AI and the Sora product specifically pose an existential threat to Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud Suite. We do not share these concerns and believe that AI is a tremendous growth opportunity for Adobe. In fact, in a recent conference call, management described how innovative AI-based solutions are expected to be drivers of growth across its product lines. ADBE is the leading software and solutions provider in the content creation and content management space. The company offers a line of products and services used by creative professionals, communicators, businesses of all sizes, and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring and optimizing content and experiences across personal computers, smartphones, other electronic devices and digital media formats.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dutchman-gets-nike-lego-wartime-091120238.html": "By Tassilo Hummel, Gleb Stolyarov, Polina, Nikolskaya and David Gauthier-Villars PARIS (Reuters) - Nike stopped selling its sportswear to Russia soon after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine over two years ago. But that hasn\u2019t stopped footballstore.ru, an online sports retailer owned by Russia\u2019s Zenit soccer club. Among the dozens of Nike-branded items the site offers are the U.S. sportswear maker\u2019s Phantom GT2 Elite soccer boots, for 29,999 roubles, or around $330. The man who got these shoes to Russia is Wijnand Herinckx, a 40-year-old Dutch citizen who lives in Moscow. Since the conflict began, Herinckx has built a thriving business that provides Russian consumers with Western goods whose makers have pulled out of Russia. \u201cNike does not want their products to be shipped to Russia,\u201d Herinckx told Reuters in a video call from his office on the outskirts of Moscow, where shelves are stacked with boxes of Western branded footwear. But he added: \u201cThey are also not telling us not to do it.\u201d Both Nike and Lego told Reuters they have not authorized Herinckx\u2019s imports of their goods to Russia. By examining customs data, corporate records and internal company documents, and by speaking to Herinckx himself, Reuters learned how his business obtains branded goods including Nike and Lego: It uses intermediaries with no apparent connection to Russia as buyers, then ships the goods to Russia \u2013 often via Turkey \u2013 and finally delivers them to retailers in Russia. There are at least dozens of firms like Herinckx\u2019s employing grey-market methods to get Western goods to Russia, according to a Reuters analysis of customs data. His operation shows how attempts by Western governments and brands to isolate Russia\u2019s economy are crashing into a reality of global business: Where there\u2019s demand, someone will meet it. Western governments\u2019 restrictions have mostly focused on industrial products that can be used to build weapons for Russia\u2019s war machine. Such products are usually subject to U.S. and European Union sanctions. Herinckx said his focus is on consumer goods not covered by sanctions. Reuters found no evidence that his firm was violating sanctions. But companies like Herinckx\u2019s are indirectly helping the Russian economy: Consumers can still buy foreign goods they\u2019ve grown used to since the collapse of communism more than a generation ago. Customs data analyzed by Reuters showed, for example, the value of Nike products imported to Russia plummeted 81% in 2022 to $21 million, but rebounded in 2023 to at least $74 million. The sportswear giant said it did not supply Herinckx\u2019s firm or any associated businesses. \u201cWe no longer have any Nike-owned physical or digital retail operations in Russia,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe do not ship any product to Russia, nor do we authorize any marketplace partners to distribute product there.\u201d It also said it has a dedicated team to investigate unauthorized distribution channels. A spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to questions about how the products were reaching Russia. In mid 2022, following Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Nike announced it was exiting Russia and Lego said it was closing its Russian business. As global brands halted sales or stopped exports over the invasion, Russia authorised businesses to import products from abroad without the trademark owner\u2019s permission. Russia said its so-called parallel imports totalled more than $70 billion in the two years up to the end of 2023. Some legal specialists say seeking recourse under Russian law would be challenging for Western brands, leaving few other legal options for brands trying to enforce intellectual property rights that are typically tied to the territory where the infringement took place. The availability of Western brands lets Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cproject a message that the war does not undermine the \u2018normal life\u2019 of the Russian middle class, \u201d said Sergei Guriev, a Russian economist who is provost at Paris\u2019 Sciences Po university. \u2018PROUD OF IT\u2019 Herinckx\u2019s Russian company employs 82 staff and forecasts revenues in 2024 of 35 million euros, or about $37 million, he said. Last year, it was $23.7 million, according to company accounts. At the time of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Herinckx was working in the Moscow office of a German company, Hellmann Worldwide Logistics. According to Herinckx, he ran a team of more than 20 people inside Hellmann that served foreign companies who wanted to sell in Russia without setting up local operations. Hellmann quickly decided to pull out of Russia. Herinckx stayed put. He had previously married a Russian woman with whom he\u2019d had children, Herinckx said. \u201cOur life is here. Everything we have we built up here,\u201d he said. He took over one of Hellmann\u2019s Russian entities, renamed it Herinckx Trade Solutions Rus (HTS Rus), and registered it in his wife\u2019s name in April 2022. Herinckx initially used Hellmann\u2019s email servers, and a variation of the Hellmann logo in his marketing. Both Herinckx and Hellmann said they had a transitional agreement to let the Dutchman use some of his old employer\u2019s infrastructure. Hellmann said the deal to use its logo expired in October 2022, and that its intellectual property was used without its consent after that. Herinckx said this was an oversight and he stopped using Hellmann logos in January 2024. Hellmann said it now has no connection to Herinckx\u2019s business and has no operational business in Russia. Among goods Herinckx\u2019s firm ships to Russia are Reebok sports shoes and Emporio Armani wristwatches, according to Herinckx and data recorded by a Russian bank that lists assets HTS Rus pledged against a loan. Herinckx said he did not have authorisation from those two brands. Armani Group said it had stopped authorised shipments to Russian distributors and does not know how HTS Rus had got hold of the products. Reebok\u2019s owner Authentic Brands Group, which said in 2022 it had suspended all branded stores and e-commerce operations in Russia, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The Dutchman\u2019s firm doesn\u2019t publicly disclose its customers. But Reuters identified some of its Russian clients by reviewing documents the company filed with Russian tax authorities. Customers included some of Russia\u2019s biggest supermarket chains and online retailers. Herinckx said his firm is a good corporate citizen that is also involved in charity work. Asked why he decided to speak publicly about his operations, he said: \u201cWhat we do is quite cool, we are proud of it.\u201d EUROPEAN ROUTE Among his achievements is importing Lego bricks. The Danish firm said it strictly enforces its policy of not selling to Russia. When it sells to retailers or distributors, it writes into the contract that they must not re-sell to Russia, according to Herinckx and Lego. To get around this, Herinckx said he inserted a chain of intermediaries between Lego and Russia. Some of the Lego bricks he buys are first bought from the manufacturer by a company in Europe that has no relation to his business, he said, declining to name the company. He then buys the bricks from that company, using a Netherlands-registered entity he owns called HTS Europe B.V., he said. The goods are then trucked directly from Europe to Russia, passing through customs checks on the way, according to Herinckx. Once in Russia, the Lego comes under the control of Herinckx\u2019s Russian business, HTS Rus, according to the loan data and tax documents. Herinckx told Reuters he supplied Lego to around 48 Russian firms, mostly specialist toy retailers. \u201cMy children play with Lego,\u201d Herinckx said. \u201cI have nothing against other children playing with Lego.\u201d Lego has problems with his operation, though. After Reuters contacted Lego for comment in late April, the Danish firm said it had written to HTS Rus accusing it of falsely claiming on its website that it collaborated with Lego. HTS Rus subsequently changed the English-language version of its website, removing an image of Lego figures and replacing it with generic children\u2019s plastic toys. The Russian-language version of the site still carried a Lego logo as of June 13. \u201cWe are concerned to learn of this flow of goods considering we stopped shipping LEGO products into Russia in March 2022,\u201d Lego said in a statement to Reuters. \u201cThis is an issue we take seriously and are acting upon, while ensuring that we comply with local laws and regulations where we continue to operate.\u201d TRANSPORTED THROUGH TURKEY Some Western goods come via Turkey, a favoured hub for grey-market imports to Russia. Herinckx said he sources Nike and some Lego products in Turkey, via a company called HTS Poer Dis Ticaret Limited Sirketi, which he said procures goods from Turkish retailers or distributors. He declined to name them. HTS Poer co-founder Murat Erbelger told Reuters the Turkish company had nothing to do with sanctioned products. \u201cWe do legitimate business,\u201d he said. Erbelger did not answer questions on HTS Poer\u2019s association with Herinckx Trade Solutions. Asked by Reuters about grey-market goods reaching Russia via Turkey, the Turkish presidency's communications directorate did not respond. Customs data for the period from June 2022 to December 2023 showed HTS Poer supplied at least $4 million worth of Nike products to Russia. Herinckx told Reuters that as far as he knew all those shipments of Nike goods were destined for his company. Once the Nike products reach Russia, they go to Herinckx\u2019s retail clients. Among them is footballstore.ru, according to tax records and the internal HTS Rus document. Russian corporate records show the retail site is 100% owned by Zenit soccer club. Zenit club is sponsored by Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-owned gas company, and is also part-owned by Gazprombank. The lender is subject to U.S. sanctions on the Russian banking sector. Gazprombank, Gazprom and Zenit didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Reuters purchased the Phantom GT2 Elite Nike soccer boots from the online retailer. They were delivered 10 days later. Nike did not comment on the shoes. The shoe box gave the date of manufacture as September 2022, three months after Nike said it stopped selling in Russia. It also bore a label that identified Herinckx\u2019s HTS Rus as the importer.

        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-is-divided-over-the-rise-of-private-credit-140058228.html": "The debate on Wall Street about the rise of private credit is getting louder. On one side is the boss of the largest US bank, Jamie Dimon, who argues that increased lending by private equity firms, money managers, and hedge funds creates more opportunities to let risks outside the regulated banking system go unmonitored. \"I do expect there to be problems,\" the JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO said at a Bernstein industry conference at the end of May, adding that \"there could be hell to pay\" if retail investors in such funds experience deep losses. On the other side are top executives from some of the world\u2019s biggest money managers who aren\u2019t hesitating to push back on that argument. \"Every dollar that moves out of the banking industry and into the investment marketplace makes the system safer and more resilient and less leveraged,\" Marc Rowan, Apollo (APO) CEO, said at the same Bernstein conference attended by Dimon. (Note: Apollo is the parent company of Yahoo Finance). Private credit funds, their proponents argue, don\u2019t face deposit runs and they don\u2019t rely on short-term funding \u2014 a model that proved troublesome for some regional banks that ran into problems last year and had to be seized by regulators. Instead, they lend money raised from large institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies that know they won\u2019t get their money back for several years. Another top executive with giant private lender Blackstone (BX) used the same Bernstein conference to cite the asset-liability mismatch that ultimately sank First Republic, the San Francisco regional bank that failed last May and was auctioned to JPMorgan. \"It had 20-year assets and 20-second deposits,\" Blackstone COO and general partner Jonathan Gray said. \"And if we can place these loans directly on the balance sheets of a life insurance company, that's better matching.\" There is little doubt that private credit is on the rise as traditional banks pull back on lending during a time of elevated interest rates from the Federal Reserve and worries about a possible economic downturn. The global private credit market, which accounts for all debt that is not issued or traded publicly, has grown from $41 billion in 2000 to $1.67 trillion through September, according to data provider Preqin. More than $1 trillion of that amount is held in North America. The sum is still small compared to total loans held by US banks \u2014 over $12 billion \u2014 but the concern by some in the banking world is that any panic among borrowers could spread if things were to get ugly. \"I'm not sure that a one-and-a-half-trillion-dollar private credit market is particularly systemic, but the point is that these things can have a snowball effect,\" UBS chairman Colm Kelleher said in a Bloomberg interview earlier this year. For now, private credit performance is solid despite the concerns. For five of the past six quarters, private credit has brought higher investor returns than it has on average over the past decade, according to an aggregate private credit index created by Preqin. It has also outperformed a similar index measuring aggregate returns in private equity for the same period. \"Everybody can look quite good when it's all going up to the right, but it gets tougher when you go through cycles,\" John Waldron, Goldman Sachs' COO, said at the same Bernstein conference. Private credit assets are varied. They can range from corporate loans to consumer car loans and some commercial mortgages. The loans are especially useful to midsize or below investment-grade borrowers in special situations like distress. The terms are usually more flexible than what banks require, with adjustable interest rates, a potential advantage or dilemma for borrowers expecting interest rates to eventually drop. Some bankers argue that money managers have an unfair advantage because they don\u2019t have to operate under the same capital requirements as banks do. And bank regulators are preparing new rules that could make those capital requirements even stricter. When those heightened standards were first proposed last year, Dimon quipped that private equity lenders were surely \"dancing in the streets.\" But there are some signs that Washington could be preparing to intensify its scrutiny of these funds. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has voted to approve a new framework for labeling firms as \"systemically important,\" a tag that triggers new oversight from the Fed. The new framework creates an opening for firms other than banks to get that label. Funds argue they don\u2019t present the same systematic risks as banks, and therefore the label is not appropriate for them. The relationship between traditional banks and private asset lenders is complicated. They compete with each other, but many banks also lend money to those same asset managers. Dimon acknowledged that, saying there are many \"brilliant\" private lenders. \"I mean, I know them all. We bank a lot of them. They're clients of ours.\" \"We're just uniquely positioned to be in the middle of all of it and I think it's going to continue to grow,\" Troy Rohrbaugh, co-CEO of JPM's commercial and investment bank, said this past Wednesday at another conference.
